  abstract={We propose a dialogue system that enables heart failure patients to inquire about salt content in foods and help them monitor and reduce salt intake. Addressing the lack of specific datasets for food-based salt content inquiries, we develop a template-based conversational dataset. The dataset is structured to ask clarification questions to identify food items and their salt content. Our findings indicate that while fine-tuning transformer-based models on the dataset yields limited performance, the integration of Neuro-Symbolic Rules significantly enhances the system's performance. Our experiments show that by integrating neuro-symbolic rules, our system achieves an improvement in joint goal accuracy of over 20% across different data sizes compared to naively fine-tuning transformer-based models.},

  title={VERUS-LM: a Versatile Framework for Combining LLMs with Symbolic Reasoning},
  year={2025},
  author={Callewaert, Benjamin and Vandevelde, Simon and Joost, Vennekens},
  abstract={A recent approach to neurosymbolic reasoning is to explicitly combine the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and symbolic solvers to tackle complex reasoning tasks. However, current approaches face significant limitations, including poor generalizability due to task-specific prompts, inefficiencies caused by the lack of separation between knowledge and queries, and restricted inferential capabilities. These shortcomings hinder their scalability and applicability across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce VERUS-LM, a novel framework designed to address these challenges. VERUS-LM employs a generic prompting mechanism, clearly separates domain knowledge from queries, and supports a wide range of different logical reasoning tasks. This framework enhances adaptability, reduces computational cost, and allows for richer forms of reasoning, such as optimization and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach succeeds in diverse reasoning on a novel dataset, markedly outperforming LLMs. Additionally, our system achieves competitive results on common reasoning benchmarks when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, and significantly surpasses them on the difficult AR-LSAT dataset. By pushing the boundaries of hybrid reasoning, VERUS-LM represents a significant step towards more versatile neurosymbolic AI systems},

  title={LogicLSTM: Logically-driven long short-term memory model for fault diagnosis in gearboxes},
  year={2024},
  volume={77},
  author={Hogea, Eduard and Onchis Darian, M. and Ruqiang, Yan and Zheng, Zhou},
  abstract={This article introduces LogicLSTM, a hybrid neuro-symbolic model obtained by logically guiding a pretrained Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with the support of a customized Logic Tensor Network (LTN). The model is further optimized by explainable AI techniques, for a refined fault classification of time-series data coming from industrial gearboxes. The framework leverages the intrinsic strengths of LSTMs deep recurrent networks for temporal data processing with logical reasoning capabilities, to improve prediction accuracy and interpretability of the classification. Our approach addresses the challenges of extracting relevant data features and integrating connectionist and symbolic methodologies to forma cohesive predictive model. Results from extensive testing show that our model significantly outperforms traditional LSTM models, particularly in complex fault scenarios where conventional methods may fail. Specifically, the hybrid model demonstrates a 16.03% average improvement in accuracy over standard LSTM models under conditions of sufficient data availability, and a 8.56% improvement in scenarios where data is scarce. This research not only demonstrates the potential of hybrid models in industrial applications but also highlights the importance of explainability in AI systems for critical decision-making processes. The proposed model's ability to interpret and explain its predictions makes it a valuable tool for advancing predictive maintenance strategies within the Industry 4.0 framework.},
