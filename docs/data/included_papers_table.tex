We show that Transformer extended with recurrence is a viable approach to learning to solve CSPs in an end-to-end manner, having clear advantages over state-of-the-art methods such as Graph Neural Networks, SATNet, and some neuro-symbolic models. \\
    \cite{rayyan-242086184} & Injecting Logical Constraints into Neural Networks via Straight-Through Estimators & This paper introduces CL-STE, a method to inject discrete logical constraints into neural networks by representing the constraints as a loss function and using a Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to enable gradient-based optimization. By leveraging GPUs and avoiding heavy symbolic computation, this technique scales significantly better than existing neuro-symbolic methods and allows various architectures, like CNNs and GNNs, to learn from constraints with fewer or no labeled data. \\
    \cite{rayyan-242086220} & Proving Olympiad Inequalities by Synergizing LLMs and Symbolic Reasoning & we introduce a neuro-symbolic tactic generator that synergizes the mathematical intuition learned by LLMs with domain-specific insights encoded by symbolic methods. \\
