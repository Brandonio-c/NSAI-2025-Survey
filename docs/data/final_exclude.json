      "Your Brief Summary on the paper \n(in 1-2 sentences, describe what the paper is presenting) ": "Introduce a specialization of a neuro-symbolic architecture, known as SOFAI (Slow and Fast AI), inspired by the cognitive framework popularized by D. Kahneman's book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\". Our system, referred to as Plan-SOFAI, aims to tackle planning problems across a large spectrum of scenarios, with a specific focus on the classical setting. Plan-SOFAI leverages multiple planning approaches, each possessing distinct characteristics and categorized as either fast or slow while incorporating a metacognitive process for governance.",

Access to the dataset has been requested. Reviewer will redo this data extraction review (if and when) the required evaluation has been made accessible i.e. once our request for access is approved. \n\nEDIT: ----------------------------\nAfter gaining access to the HighD dataset and saving it into our local data/highd/ path, we were still unable to reproduce the paper’s results due to environment fragility and undocumented steps. Specifically, the codebase depends on manual patches to PySwip (adding a non-standard Prolog.reconsult() method and changing PL_version --> PL_version_info for SWI-Prolog 9.0.4). In our HPC/conda setup, even with SWI-Prolog correctly installed and PySwip importable, evaluation and training failed wherever reconsult() was called (e.g., in train.py and reproduce/evaluate.py), raising AttributeError: 'Prolog' object has no attribute 'reconsult'. Additional headless issues from Pygame/ALSA appeared but were mitigated with SDL_* env vars; however, the PySwip mismatch remained a hard blocker. Because the repository provides only a minimal, unpinned requirements.txt and no container/conda spec to unify SWI-Prolog+PySwip ABI versions, we could not execute the full 50-episode evaluation protocol despite having the required HighD data.\n"

    "title": "Learning for Long-Horizon Planning via Neuro-Symbolic Abductive Imitation",
    "year": "2024",
    "author": "Shao, Jie-Jing and Hao, Hao-Ran and Yang, Xiao-Wen and Yu-Feng, Li",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Recent learning-to-imitation methods have shown promising results in planning via imitating within the observation-action space. However, their ability in open environments remains constrained, particularly in long-horizon tasks. In contrast, traditional symbolic planning excels in long-horizon tasks through logical reasoning over human-defined symbolic spaces but struggles to handle observations beyond symbolic states, such as high-dimensional visual inputs encountered in real-world scenarios. In this work, we draw inspiration from abductive learning and introduce a novel framework 𝐀B ductive 𝐈 mitation 𝐋 earning (ABIL) that integrates the benefits of data-driven learning and symbolic-based reasoning, enabling long-horizon planning. Specifically, we employ abductive reasoning to understand the demonstrations in symbolic space and design the principles of sequential consistency to resolve the conflicts between perception and reasoning. ABIL generates predicate candidates to facilitate the perception from raw observations to symbolic space without laborious predicate annotations, providing a groundwork for symbolic planning. With the symbolic understanding, we further develop a policy ensemble whose base policies are built with different logical objectives and managed through symbolic reasoning. Experiments show that our proposal successfully understands the observations with the task-relevant symbolics to assist the imitation learning. Importantly, ABIL demonstrates significantly improved data efficiency and generalization across various long-horizon tasks, highlighting it as a promising solution for long-horizon planning.

Trying to “modernize in place” then collides with a second constraint: the paper’s metrics rely on TF-1 (which needs ≤Python 3.7), while training reasonably requires a much newer PyTorch/CUDA; mixing those in a single env triggers unsatisfiable solves and runtime errors (NumPy/OpenBLAS crashes, ABI mismatches). On the data side, one official MPI3D link is dead, and the alternative requires extra steps (label injection) not automated in the repo; the preprocessing bundle (preprocessing.zip with scripts/k-means pickles) isn’t publicly hosted, so parts of the pipeline can’t run end-to-end. In short, obsolete dependencies, hardware/driver incompatibilities, a non-portable metrics toolchain, and missing/decayed data resources collectively block a faithful reproduction. "

The documentation is minimal and error-prone: the very commands to run experiments reference a misspelled path (scrips/ instead of scripts/), which likely makes the provided invocations non-functional without manual fixes. While the paper gives only high-level training specs (Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 base; LoRA rank 8; <=3 epochs; batch size 4), it does not provide accompanying checkpoints, full hyperparameter files, seeds, or an evaluation harness needed to exactly match reported numbers, making faithful reproduction impractical with public assets alone."

Hence, we were unable to reproduce the reported results after multiple attempts. The root cause is in the authors’ original test scripts (e.g., run_*_test.sh) which override environment variables with hard-coded, non-existent paths, use outdated/invalid shell syntax and activation commands, and assume undocumented distributed settings. This was particularly disappointing to see as we ( the annotators for this survey ) spent days on gathering all of the artefacts necessary ( code, model weights, dataset etc.), setting up the environment properly and generating the wrapper necessary to run the evaluation bash scripts on Zaratan with the 8 GPU's required ( but not specified in the documentation - another issue with reproduction). We believed that this effort would not be in vain as this repo is from a reputable source (meta) and was published withina. reputable conferences ( ICCV from CVF and IEEE Xplore) and the GitHub repo seems to provide all the necessary artefacts ( model weights, data, full code and evaluation scripts). Additionally, the repo provides a dockerfile for docker reproduction, but reproduction using a containerised environment requires apptainer ( as 8 GPU's are needed and most HPC's do not give root access which docker requires) and the docker script ( upon further inspection) is does not provide access points required to reproduce the experiment, it is just a framework shell that sets up the dependencies. So, tl;dr, this failed reproduction was particularly disappointing as it seemed ( from the outside) that the authors provided everything required but upon further inspection, it is clear that the framework testing scripts have never been tested ( apart from possibly on the authors machine ) and the containerized environment offered is just a shell that would not allow for the reproduction of experimental results.

Although the datasets used (e.g., MRI data) are publicly accessible, the lack of implementation details for the neural components, rule-generation pipeline, and neuro-symbolic integration prevents exact replication. Follow-up actions include checking whether the authors plan to release code in future revisions, contacting them for implementation details, and documenting any assumptions needed if attempting an independent re-implementation."

The study demands complex data input, specifically combining high-resolution RGB with a Canopy Height Model (CHM). However, the authors explicitly confirmed the omission of detailed configuration files and data processing guides necessary to create this CHM from raw LiDAR data. This undocumented geospatial pipeline acts as a major technical barrier, forcing any user to rebuild a specialized data preprocessing system from the ground up."

These are fundamental, immediately visible deficiencies that fail basic standards for research transparency and reproducibility; on cursory inspection, such a repository should not pass a reproducibility check or peer review predicated on code availability."

In FB15k and FB51k-237, CVTs have been removed, thereby eliminating valuable information. To evaluate whether KGEMs can learn semantically accurate representations of entities and relations in Freebase, we introduce here a new dataset named FB15k-CVT, which reintroduces the deleted CVT nodes.

      "Notes on reproduction": "Environment setup was completed successfully on the Zaratan HPC Cluster, including installation of SWI-Prolog 8.4.3 from source, Python 3.10 virtual environment creation, and all required dependencies (PyTorch, pyswip, etc.). The MNIST dataset was downloaded without issues and HPC job submission worked as expected. However, code execution revealed multiple critical bugs preventing reproduction of the paper's main contributions. The wsabl.py script (Weakly Supervised ABL), which represents the paper's primary novel method, crashes immediately with an IndexError at line 83 in the aggregate_() function. The valabl.py script fails with an AttributeError due to a type mismatch where a list object is passed instead of a PyTorch tensor at line 206 in the _predict() method. The unsupabl.py script encountered disk quota errors related to wandb logging, though deeper issues may exist beyond this environmental constraint.\n\nOnly the nabl.py script (Naive ABL), which serves as the baseline comparison rather than the paper's novel contribution, executed successfully. This indicates that the environment configuration is correct but the implementation of the paper's main methods contains bugs. Additionally, the README documentation references examples (hwf, hwf-cifar, hwf-svhn) that are absent from the repository, further hindering reproduction efforts. Multiple critical code bugs in the novel methods (wsabl.py and valabl.py) prevent execution and make it impossible to verify any experimental results reported in the paper. While the baseline comparison method works, the paper's core contributions remain unverifiable due to these implementation failures.",

Only the baseline method (nabl.py) executes successfully, which is insufficient to verify the paper's claims. Environment setup completed without issues on Zaratan HPC, confirming these are implementation bugs rather than dependency problems. The repository also lacks documented examples (hwf, hwf-cifar, hwf-svhn) mentioned in the README.\n\nAction items for authors: Fix the IndexError at line 83 in weakly_supervised_abl_model.py, resolve the AttributeError at line 206 in basic_nn.py where list objects need tensor conversion, add missing example datasets referenced in documentation, and provide pre-trained checkpoints or verified run scripts to enable reproduction. Until these critical bugs are addressed, the paper's experimental results cannot be independently verified. Recommend exclusion under Criterion #10 (code fails to execute) until authors provide a working implementation."

The project specifies PyTorch 1.0.1 (2019, built for CUDA 9.0/10.0). Initial runs failed due to a missing matplotlib dependency, which was resolved. A subsequent attempt showed that PyTorch 1.0.1 lacks TransformerEncoderLayer (introduced in PyTorch 1.2.0), required by the NPQA model. After upgrading PyTorch to support this class, all three test cases (ML100K, Amazon5MoviesTV, and Amazon5KindleStore) failed with a CUDA runtime error (CUBLAS_STATUS_EXECUTION_FAILED) during the first forward pass, caused by PyTorch 1.0.1’s CUDA binaries being incompatible with CUDA 11.8. Upgrading to a CUDA 11.8-compatible PyTorch (e.g., 1.12+) would likely require retraining the provided checkpoints, as they were saved with PyTorch 1.0.1 and may not be compatible with newer versions. The codebase targets an older software stack that cannot be replicated without substantial dependency updates, model architecture changes, or access to the original training environment. Reproduction was therefore deemed infeasible."

These trained weights are essential for evaluation-only reproduction of the exact published models and metrics, which is the standard required by our study. Without access to these checkpoints, we cannot directly load and evaluate the original models; any attempt to retrain NSP and baselines would yield only an approximate reproduction that depends on new random initializations, training noise, and potentially undocumented hyperparameter details. Because the central NLI claims hinge on these unreleased checkpoints, the paper does not meet our “all artifacts public” requirement "

While the repository provides code, datasets, and training commands, it only supports retraining from scratch; there are no serialized weights, no model releases, and no external model hosting referenced in the paper, README, or associated project pages. As a consequence, it is impossible to (a) directly load and evaluate the exact trained instances used to generate the published numbers, or (b) reproduce any analyses that depend on those specific parameter settings (e.g., rule sets, attention patterns, or exact performance points) without rerunning the entire training procedure and obtaining potentially different models. Our study requires that all core artifacts—code, data, and the original trained models—be publicly available to allow evaluation-only reproduction and exact model inspection. Because the pretrained checkpoints are missing and cannot be located in any public venue, the paper does not satisfy this requirement and must therefore be excluded."

In addition, the experiment scripts themselves are structurally broken: they contain hard-coded Windows-style paths (e.g. .\\datasets\\\\reclor\\\\npy\\\\val.npy) that are not portable to a standard Linux HPC environment; they implement arbitrary sample caps (e.g. 50–100 examples) directly in the experiment code, which prevents full-dataset evaluation unless the user edits the core scripts; and they mishandle the types and formats returned by the LLM functions (e.g. expecting lists where strings are returned, wrong dataset keys such as 'choices' vs 'answers'), causing direct baselines and CoT-SC runs to crash or silently produce invalid outputs. Because (1) the key LLM behavior is unspecified and must be written by the user, (2) the released code contains logic and path errors that prevent out-of-the-box execution on standard infrastructure, and (3) there is no authoritative, working reference implementation that ties the prompts, model calls, and evaluation together, the paper’s reported results cannot be independently and faithfully reproduced from the public artifacts.

Attempting to construct an environment from scratch immediately runs into hard dependency conflicts (e.g., farm-haystack requires transformers==4.39.3 while the repo and current ecosystem pull in incompatible transformers builds), and the paper/README give no guidance on exact framework versions required to load and run the released models without guesswork. (2) The core DSL runtime (from NeuroQL import *, NeuroQL.load, NeuroQL.answer, etc.) is not released as a public Python package or source, and the referenced hosted environment (https://orgdlabs.com/neuroql_eg) is not accessible, making the language-level contribution and end-to-end examples non-reproducible. (3) There are no documented training/evaluation scripts or configs for the released checkpoints; only opaque model directories and a playground notebook are provided, with no explicit instructions for how to run the exact evaluation pipelines used to produce the reported metrics. Hence, this means that any attempt to “reproduce” the results would require substantial reverse engineering of the environment, ad-hoc dependency downgrades, and re-implementation of un-documented components making it out of scope for this survey.

      "Comments on reproduction / Action items / follow‑up needed (if applicable) ": "We cloned the public Satyrn repository, created the satyrn conda environment as described in the README, and installed all dependencies. During our attempts to reproduce the results, we had to fix several code and configuration issues just to get the architecture to initialize: we added the repo root to sys.path so core can be imported, changed our harness to read rings via app.rings because the documented /api/rings/ endpoint is not actually implemented, and added logic to correct placeholder paths in site.json so that ring JSON files can be found. These fixes were necessary before any data-dependent behaviour could even be exercised, indicating that the repository is not even in a workable state\n\nThe main blocker then emerged at the ring/database layer. All ring JSON files we inspected have empty connectionString fields, and the README points to a satyrn-rings resource that now returns a 404, so there is no ready-made ring plus database bundle or clear, working configuration that corresponds to the paper’s experiments. The repository does include *-dump.sql files in data/ which appear to be PostgreSQL dumps, implying that each ring is expected to point at a PostgreSQL database restored from these dumps, but there is no end-to-end, tested documentation for how to instantiate these databases, wire them into the ring configs, and obtain a set of valid rings. We therefore created our own helper infrastructure, including a setup_databases.sh script to automate restoring the dumps and updating connection strings, but this is effectively reconstructing missing artifacts and documentation rather than following a provided, canonical setup.\n\nAs a result, although we can import and initialize the Satyrn Flask app, inspect ring metadata, and verify that the high-level architectural components are wired together, we cannot obtain a working, data-backed ring configuration that allows SQR analysis or report generation to run over real databases. Without such a configuration, the core experimental pipeline of the paper (running analytics over rings, generating factual statements, producing LLM reports, and recomputing factual/refuted/confabulated claim rates and UniEval scores) cannot be executed as described. Because this failure is driven by missing artifacts (no accessible satyrn-rings resource, empty connection strings, undocumented database setup) and code/API inconsistencies in the released repository, we exclude Satyrn from the set of fully reproduced systems and treat it only as an architecture-level validation rather than a faithful reproduction of the paper’s quantitative results."

    "abstract": "Relational learning can be described as the task of learning first-order logic rules from examples. It has enabled a number of new machine learning applications, e.g. graph mining and link analysis. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) performs relational learning either directly by manipulating first-order rules or through propositionalization, which translates the relational task into an attribute-value learning task by representing subsets of relations as features. In this paper, we introduce a fast method and system for relational learning based on a novel propositionalization called Bottom Clause Propositionalization (BCP). Bottom clauses are boundaries in the hypothesis search space used by ILP systems Progol and Aleph. Bottom clauses carry semantic meaning and can be mapped directly onto numerical vectors, simplifying the feature extraction process. We have integrated BCP with a well-known neural-symbolic system, C-(ILP)-P-2, to perform learning from numerical vectors. C-(ILP)-P-2 uses background knowledge in the form of propositional logic programs to build a neural network. The integrated system, which we call CILP++, handles first-order logic knowledge and is available for download from Sourceforge. We have evaluated CILP++ on seven ILP datasets, comparing results with Aleph and a well-known propositionalization method, RSD. The results show that CILP++ can achieve accuracy comparable to Aleph, while being generally faster, BCP achieved statistically significant improvement in accuracy in comparison with RSD when running with a neural network, but BCP and RSD perform similarly when running with C4.5. We have also extended CILP++ to include a statistical feature selection method, mRMR, with preliminary results indicating that a reduction of more than 90 % of features can be achieved with a small loss of accuracy.",

These builds do not exist for linux-64, causing conda env create to fail with PackagesNotFoundError for multiple core libraries. Because the file pins low-level, platform-specific builds instead of giving a portable environment specification, it cannot be used as-is on a standard Linux cluster and would require substantial manual guesswork and re-engineering (stripping out system packages, relaxing pins, and reconstructing the environment by trial and error).\n\nWe are therefore excluding this work from our reproducibility study. The environment file is non-portable and effectively unusable outside the authors’ original machine, and there is a severe lack of documentation on how to set up a cross-platform environment, what minimal dependencies are required, and how to run the code end-to-end without relying on this Mac-specific lockfile. Any attempt to “fix” the environment would be speculative and could materially change behavior, so we cannot claim a faithful reproduction under rigorous standards."

Despite extensive searching across the official GitHub repository, the dataset Google Drive folder, the ACL Anthology entry, the authors’ personal pages, and general web sources, none of these artifacts exist in any public location.\n\nThese missing components are necessary to reproduce the exact experimental outcomes reported in the paper, because EngineKG’s performance depends on (a) the precise learned embedding parameters at convergence, (b) the initial and iterative rule sets used in the closed-loop algorithm, and (c) the detailed hyperparameter and preprocessing configuration that produced the published models. Without these artifacts, only approximate re-training is possible, which cannot verify or falsify the authors’ reported numbers. "

While the core LNN framework from IBM is available via IBM's github, the LNN-EL task-specific implementation (including its full feature-generation pipeline, rule-instantiation code, training scripts, hyperparameter configurations, dataset splits, and all pretrained LNN-EL model checkpoints) is absent. These components are essential for reproducing every major quantitative result in the paper (F1 scores, Recall@k, transfer results, and runtime metrics). Although the underlying datasets (LC-QuAD, QALD-9, WebQSP-EL) are public, the authors’ exact processed forms, span annotations, candidate sets, feature extraction logic, and rule-network construction—each of which directly affects evaluation outcomes—are not available. Without these artifacts, no experiment reported in the paper can be reproduced with fidelity, and any attempted re-implementation would be approximate at best, not a valid reproduction. "

Many implementation-critical details are described only abstractly in the paper and cannot be reliably inferred or recreated without access to the original codebase.\n\nFurthermore, the primary dataset used throughout the paper (CoNLL-2003) is not openly accessible and requires licensed access.

Both environment files provided in the repository (the TensorFlow requirements and the PyTorch requirements) are not genuine dependency specifications but corrupted exports of an old workstation environment. These files contain mutually contradictory package constraints, including Python-2-only modules mixed with Python-3-only modules, obsolete package pins whose wheels no longer exist, and hard failures such as the requirement to install conda==4.5.11 through pip, which has never been possible. Even after cleaning obvious errors, the environment fails to resolve because many pinned versions are from incompatible eras of TensorFlow, TensorBoard, CUDA, and PyTorch.\n\nThe TensorFlow environment file explicitly demands the installation of functools32, a Python-2-exclusive backport that aborts immediately under any Python-3 interpreter. Simultaneously, the same file pins TensorFlow 1.x and associated libraries that do not support Python 2 in the specified versions, meaning no version of Python can satisfy the full set of constraints. The PyTorch environment file exhibits identical defects and includes both CPU and GPU TensorFlow packages, conflicting versions of TensorBoard, and legacy deep-learning dependencies that cannot be installed together on modern systems due to missing wheels and abandoned builds.\n\nThese failures are structural, not incidental. The environment specs cannot be cleaned or repaired without effectively rewriting the entire dependency tree, which violates the principle of faithful reproduction. Since the authors did not provide a valid environment specification, and no version of Python or pip can install the dependencies as pinned, the artifacts required to execute the codebase are broken beyond feasible recovery."

The repository hard-codes calls to openai.ChatCompletion.create(...) throughout the reasoning pipeline, and all higher-level components ( including semantic prompting, backoff logic, and tenacity-wrapped inference) are built around this obsolete interface. Because the modern OpenAI client no longer contains these methods, every invocation triggers immediate failures and infinite retry loops. This makes the pipeline non-functional under any currently supported OpenAI Python version.\n\nAttempts to manually patch or modernize the code are not viable, because the breakage propagates deeply through the architecture. Updating the SDK requires substantial refactoring across models/utils.py, SemanticPrompting.py, logic_reasoning.py, and all modules that construct or parse ChatCompletion messages. The code is brittle, heavily intertwined, and relies on undocumented or outdated assumptions about response objects, message formats, and API semantics that no longer exist. Even incremental fixes produce cascading errors, demonstrating that the provided artifacts are not robust to API migration and cannot be repaired without re-engineering core system behavior.\n\nNot being able to reproduce this work due to its dependency on the outdated OpenAI dependence shows the fundamental brittleness of frameworks that have relied solely on API calls.

That means all scripts that rely on QG_FIT.py (including the official training and evaluation entrypoints needed to reproduce the paper’s results) are non-executable in the released state. There is no code path that avoids this import; the failure occurs before any runtime logic or configuration choice can kick in.\n\nThis is a code integrity problem in the released artifact, not a missing external dataset or a tunable environment mismatch.

This makes evaluation-only reproduction of the published models impossible and prevents us from verifying their exact reported numbers without retraining and accepting uncontrolled randomness. In addition, the paper reports results on (1) custom unseen-entity splits for SMD and MultiWOZ and (2) a synthetic multi-hop TOD+KB dataset used heavily in the generalization and reasoning experiments. These data artifacts are not clearly released or documented in the public repo or paper (no download links, no split files, no generation scripts). As a result, several central claims (about robustness to unseen entities, multi-hop reasoning performance on the synthetic benchmark, and human evaluation of the released model) cannot be reproduced exactly, even if we re-implement the system.

Isabelle integration was misconfigured (wrong dirs path, misuse of session_build for standard HOL) and systematically failed with Pydantic validation errors, blocking all runs until core logic was rewritten. Isabelle sessions were being built unnecessarily, the formalisation/ directory was not created before use, and JSON serialization of internal TaskOK objects caused hard crashes in syntax/proof checks. Path resolution relied on brittle assumptions about symlinks and absolute paths, and shutdown logic produced noisy asyncio errors that obscured real failures. All of this required non-trivial architectural changes (not just wrappers or config tweaks) to make the system run, so the original public artifact is effectively malformed/buggy and cannot be used as-is to claim strict, clean reproduction of the reported results."

There is also no evaluation harness or script exposed (e.g., no clear evaluate.py or test runner), so we cannot systematically recompute the reported metrics from model outputs.

These missing components directly underpin a substantial portion of the main results (all Criminal-BERT and BERT-ts-L1 rows in the main table, Law-Match baselines, and LLM-based explanation evaluations).

Trained checkpoints for the main model are also unavailable, preventing evaluation-only replication. While the DWI follow-up experiment is reproducible from its public code and data, the primary contributions and headline results of the paper (on MSJudge/private lending) is not available at all and hence the main experiments reported on cannot be reproduced.

      "Author‑reported limitations": "Performance is described as “miserable” on most standard NLI/QA benchmarks oriented toward machine learning systems.\n\nThe system’s performance on HANS is limited by errors from the Stanza UD parser.\n\nReasoning with very large (~1GB) knowledge bases causes search-space explosion, leading to timeouts and scalability issues.\n\nThe implementation is a research prototype, not optimized for broad coverage or high-throughput production deployment.",

In particular, (1) there are no released checkpoints for the AMS (AM-Parser) models, (2) no released checkpoints for the scope dependency parser (SuPar model), and (3) the seq2seq baseline models (byT5, mT5, mBART, T5 variants on PMB) are only documented via reported scores, with no public weights or fully specified, runnable training/inference code. Although the architecture and training procedure can be re-implemented and retrained from public code and data, our study requires the ability to directly run the original published models and all baselines under identical conditions. Because these key model artifacts are missing, we cannot verify the exact reported numbers nor execute the baseline systems locally, so the paper is not reprodicuble. "

The GitHub repository provides the NSG implementation but not the full training pipeline: the curated Java corpus, data preprocessing scripts, and trained NSG model checkpoints from the paper are missing. Reproducing the exact numbers would require reconstructing the dataset described in the paper and retraining the 63M-parameter model for ~72 GPU-hours, as well as re-running baseline transformers; this is beyond the scope of our reproduction effort."

      "Comments on reproduction / Action items / follow‑up needed (if applicable) ": "\n\nThis paper fails basic reproducibility standards due to multiple severe bugs that prevent any code execution. The repository appears to contain experimental/development code that was never validated for public release.\n\nThe most critical blocking issue is corrupted data labels where label values (0-9) exceed the declared class count (3), suggesting data files are from a different experiment version or preprocessing failed entirely. This cannot be resolved without author intervention to provide correct data. Additionally, there is a fundamental type mismatch where the schema declares integer IDs but data contains string IDs with hyphens (e.g., \"kristen-1961\"), which broke on the first database query and indicates the code was never tested with the provided data files.\n\nThe dependency documentation is severely lacking. The code requires Gurobi, a commercial solver costing approximately $2400/year for academic licenses, but this is not clearly documented. While an AD3 alternative exists in the code, there are no instructions on how to use it, making setup impossible for independent researchers. Furthermore, the provided configurations have GPU hardcoded despite CPU support existing, the weighted loss implementation is broken with tensor shape mismatches, and no validated example configuration is provided.\n\nBefore this work can be considered reproducible, authors must validate and fix the data files, provide at least one working example configuration that has been fully tested, document the complete setup procedure with step-by-step installation and execution instructions, clarify the Gurobi versus AD3 dependency choice with working examples for both, add data validation and sanity checks to catch type and label mismatches early, and test the entire setup in a clean environment using Docker or conda to verify it works from scratch.\n\nWithout author fixes, achieving reproducibility would require an estimated 20+ hours of deep debugging to regenerate data files, fix the label preprocessing pipeline, debug neural network tensor shapes, create working configurations, and document proper setup procedures. With proper author fixes and documentation, setup time could be reduced to 1-2 hours. This situation is particularly problematic because this EMNLP 2022 System Demonstration paper has been cited by others, the DRaiL framework has been used in subsequent publications, and researchers attempting to build on this work will face the same barriers, ultimately undermining trust in publicly released research software.\n\nThe reproduction attempt should be rejected with a strong recommendation to contact the authors about providing corrected data files, creating validated setup documentation, and testing the code in a clean environment before claiming public availability. While the conceptual contributions may be sound, the released implementation is not usable by the research community in its current state and does not meet the standards expected for reproducible research software."

We successfully cloned the GitHub repository, verified it corresponds to the paper, and found that all datasets (Active-Logical and SCAN) are included and properly structured. We established the computational environment by creating a conda environment with Python 3.8, installing PyTorch 2.4.1 with CUDA 12.3.0 support, and all required dependencies including PyTorch Geometric, wandb, nltk, and numpy. After resolving a version conflict between torch, torchvision, and torchaudio, we confirmed all packages import correctly and CUDA is detected. The codebase itself is functional and the repository structure appears complete with all necessary scripts.\n\nHowever, we must reject this submission because the repository lacks trained model checkpoints required for reproducing the paper's reported results. The README provides a command for SCAN evaluation that explicitly uses the flag \"test_most_recent_checkpoint=1\", indicating it expects pre-existing trained models. We conducted a thorough search of the repository for checkpoint files with extensions like .pt or .pth and found none. Without these artifacts, reproducing the specific quantitative metrics reported in the paper is not possible through evaluation alone. Additionally, the repository provides no specification of expected metric values, random seeds for deterministic reproduction, or hardware requirements. The documentation is misleading as it labels commands as \"test commands\" for evaluation when no checkpoints exist to test against. For this work to meet reproducibility standards, the authors must provide trained model checkpoints, separate training from evaluation documentation, specify expected results with tolerance ranges, and document all implementation details including random seeds and exact library versions."

However, it completely lacks the experimental evaluation code necessary to reproduce the quantitative results and metrics reported in the paper. Specifically, the following critical components are missing: (1) no experiments, benchmarks, or evaluation directories; (2) no evaluation scripts or automation for running experiments; (3) no datasets or data processing pipelines; (4) no trained neural network models or model artifacts; (5) no documentation on how to reproduce paper results; and (6) no instructions for setting up experimental environments.\n\nA comprehensive search of the repository including all branches and commit history revealed only development-related commits focused on bug fixes and feature additions to the transpiler itself. Even a commit titled \"Experiments and fixes for submission\" from February 2022 contained only code refactoring and a trivial test program, not actual experimental evaluation infrastructure.\n\nThe README file provides clear instructions for using the transpiler tool to compile SPLL programs into Python or Julia code, but makes no mention of experiments, benchmarks, or how to reproduce any quantitative claims from the paper. The test cases included are purely syntactic examples demonstrating language constructs like conditionals, loops, and probabilistic distributions, not the experimental scenarios evaluated in the paper.\n\nAction items for the authors: The authors need to provide a complete experimental evaluation package including all scripts used to generate results, datasets or links to obtain them, trained model checkpoints, environment setup instructions, and clear documentation mapping each experiment in the paper to specific commands or scripts in the repository. Without this infrastructure, the quantitative claims in the paper cannot be independently verified or reproduced.\n"

Requirements specify jaxlib==0.4.20+cuda12.cudnn89 which is unavailable via pip\n2. Installing current JAX versions (0.4.34+) results in API incompatibility \n3. Code cannot execute with any available JAX version on modern infrastructure\n4. Repository has not been maintained for compatibility with current library versions (JAX 0.4.9 from 2023 vs current 0.8.1)\n\nCONCLUSION: Paper experiments cannot be reproduced without access to the exact historical environment (JAX 0.4.20 with specific CUDA configuration) used by authors. Repository requires code updates to work with current dependency versions."

In practice, this stack is internally incompatible and fails before any experiments can be run. Specifically, vLLM 0.2.1.post1 contains a known bug where it attempts to set torch.bfloat16 as the global default dtype, which is not supported by PyTorch 2.0.1 and causes hard crashes in model_loader._set_default_torch_dtype. In addition, vLLM 0.2.1.post1 has undocumented tight coupling to Ray internals (e.g. ray.air.util.torch_dist) and to NumPy 1.x ABI; with current Ray and NumPy 2.x, it raises import and binary compatibility errors. The repository’s requirements.txt pins outdated vLLM and torch versions but leaves Ray and NumPy unpinned, so a straightforward installation (even when matching the documented torch/CUDA versions) produces a broken environment.\n\nRecovering a runnable setup would require non-trivial patching or forking of vLLM (to fix the dtype handling and Ray/NumPy assumptions) or a full downgrade to an unmaintained 2023 dependency stack, beyond what we consider reasonable for a reproducibility study. Because the failures are rooted in the released architecture’s dependency design rather than in minor configuration issues, we classify this paper as non-reproducible under realistic modern environments and exclude it from our survey."

      "Comments on reproduction / Action items / follow‑up needed (if applicable) ": "MISSING ARTIFACTS:\nThis paper relies critically on (1) the NRPP (Nearly-Regular Patterns with Perspective) dataset, consisting of ~64 Internet images of man-made nearly-regular patterns (lattices, circular arrangements, etc.) together with human-annotated camera poses and 2D object-location annotations (e.g., centers of repeated elements), and (2) the PG-IM / Neural Painting Network (NPN) implementation and weights used for the program-guided image-manipulation pipeline (inpainting/extrapolation/regularity editing). While the GitHub repository does provide a pre-trained ImageNet CNN checkpoint (AlexNet-style) used solely as a generic feature extractor, this is not the only required model artifact: the PG-IM/NPN models that actually perform the pixel-level manipulations are not included or linked, and we found no public code or weights for them. Likewise, despite extensive searching, the NRPP dataset (images plus their camera-pose and object-location annotations) is not available as a public download from the paper, the authors’ sites, the project pages, or any standard data host, and no equivalent public mirror could be identified. Because all reported quantitative results (camera pose estimation, repeated pattern detection, and inpainting metrics) are evaluated on NRPP, and all image-manipulation demonstrations depend on the unavailable PG-IM/NPN models, we cannot independently recompute the key metrics or reproduce the main qualitative demos under a “public artifacts only” reproducibility standard. As a result, the core empirical claims of the paper are not verifiable from public resources."

The approach is a tool-augmented neural policy with black-box program execution, not a neuro-symbolic architecture with explicit symbolic representations or reasoning modules; “hybrid neuro-symbolic systems” is mentioned only once in the abstract as a positioning phrase, and is not developed in the method or experiments. \n\nAdditionally, the linked GitHub repository (ReTool-RL/ReTool) provides an AIME24/25 evaluation harness and prompts only (no RL training code, data-construction pipeline, or baseline training scripts), so fully reproducing the reported results requires additional external artifacts (VeRL recipes, HF checkpoints, custom sandbox infra) and is substantially more complex than the public repo suggests."

The failure occurs in remove_tables() when tables have column headers and many blank rows: the code first builds a headers list aligned with table_rows, then shortens table_rows during blank-row compaction without updating headers. The final loop indexes headers[idx] while iterating table_rows, so idx can exceed len(headers) − 1, triggering the exception.\n\nBecause this error happens before parsed artifacts are produced under benchmarks/*/parsed/, the full pipeline cannot proceed to synthesis or evaluation. Skipping the offending pages would yield an incomplete, biased evaluation and invalidate parity with the paper. Consequently, the repository in its current state could not have produced the reported experimental results unless a different (patched) parser was used.

We attempted multiple fresh downloads and reruns (clean envs, different nodes) and consistently hit the same checkpoint-loading failure for WebQSP and near-zero F1 after the symbolic executor on CQA. Given the large result gap and the faulty model file persisting across repeated attempts, we conclude the study’s results are not reproducible with the publicly provided artifacts and exclude on that basis."
