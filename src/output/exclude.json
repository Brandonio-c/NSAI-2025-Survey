    "abstract": "Sentiment analysis has transitioned from classifying the sentiment of an entire sentence to providing the contextual information of what targets exist in a sentence, what sentiment the individual targets have, and what the causal words responsible for that sentiment are. However, this has led to elaborate requirements being placed on the datasets needed to train neural networks on the joint triplet task of determining an entity, its sentiment, and the causal words for that sentiment. Requiring this kind of data for training systems is problematic, as they suffer from stacking subjective annotations and domain over-fitting leading to poor model generalisation when applied in new contexts. These problems are also likely to be compounded as we attempt to jointly determine additional contextual elements in the future. To mitigate these problems, we present a hybrid neural-symbolic method utilising a Dependency Tree-LSTM's compositional sentiment parse structure and complementary symbolic rules to correctly extract target-sentiment-cause triplets from sentences without the need for triplet training data. We show that this method has the potential to perform in line with state-of-the-art approaches while also simplifying the data required and providing a degree of interpretability through the Tree-LSTM.",

    "abstract": "Even though Transformers are extensively used for Natural Language Processing tasks, especially for machine translation, they lack an explicit memory to store key concepts of processed texts. This paper explores the properties of the content of symbolic working memory added to the Transformer model decoder. Such working memory enhances the quality of model predictions in machine translation task and works as a neural-symbolic representation of information that is important for the model to make correct translations. The study of memory content revealed that translated text keywords are stored in the working memory, pointing to the relevance of memory content to the processed text. Also, the diversity of tokens and parts of speech stored in memory correlates with the complexity of the corpora for machine translation task.",

    "abstract": "The study and understanding of human behaviour is relevant to computer science, artificial intelligence, neural computation, cognitive science, philosophy, psychology, and several other areas. Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour, among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning. Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification. This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts: Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.",

    "abstract": "Background: Phlebitis is the commonest complication of intravenous infusion. It has been suggested that it is initiated by venoconstriction at the infusion site, hence treatment with a vasodilator may reduce its incidence. Methods: A prospective controlled study was carried out on the effect of transdermal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) and topical anti-inflammatory gel (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; NSAID) on the survival of peripheral intravenous infusion in 386 patients. Results: A total of 34.9% (43 out of 123) of the infusions failed in the control group compared with 14.1% (18 out of 127) in the NSAID group (P < 0.05) and 30.8% (43 out of 136) in the GTN group (P < 0.05). In the control group 31 positive cultures were obtained. Twenty-one positive cultures were obtained in the GTN group and four cases of bacterial proliferation were observed in the NSAID group. Conclusions: Infusion phlebitis is a common problem in hospitalized patients and its incidence can be effectively reduced by NSAI gel and GTN but NSAI gel is more effective than GTN.",

    "year": "2019",
    "author": "Gil, Dario and William, M. J. Green",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The laptops, cell phones, and internet applications commonplace in our daily lives are all rooted in the idea of zeros and ones - in bits. This foundational element originated from the combination of mathematics and Claude Shannon's Theory of Information. Coupled with the 50-year legacy of Moore's Law, the bit has propelled the digitization of our world. In recent years, artificial intelligence systems, merging neuron-inspired biology with information, have achieved superhuman accuracy in a range of narrow classification tasks by learning from labelled data. Advancing from Narrow AI to Broad AI will encompass the unification of learning and reasoning through neuro-symbolic systems, resulting in a form of AI which will perform multiple tasks, operate across multiple domains, and learn from small quantities of multi-modal input data. Finally, the union of physics and information led to the emergence of Quantum Information Theory and the development of the quantum bit - the qubit - forming the basis of quantum computers. We have built the first programmable quantum computers, and although the technology is still in its early days, these systems offer the potential to solve problems which even the most powerful classical computers cannot. The future of computing will look fundamentally different than it has in the past. It will not be based on more and cheaper bits alone, but rather, it will be built upon bits + neurons + qubits. This future will enable the next generation of intelligent mission-critical systems and accelerate the rate of science-driven discovery.",

However, they have been found to lack effective reasoning and cognitive ability. On the other hand, symbolic systems exhibit exceptional cognitive intelligence but suffer from poor learning capabilities when compared to neural systems. Recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies, an ideal solution emerges: combining neural systems and symbolic systems to create neural-symbolic learning systems that possess powerful perception and cognition. The purpose of this paper is to survey the advancements in neural-symbolic learning systems from four distinct perspectives: challenges, methods, applications, and future directions. By doing so, this research aims to propel this emerging field forward, offering researchers a comprehensive and holistic overview.

Nevertheless, they are widely used, in particular by the obstetricians. During pregnancy, the potential toxicity of these drugs is double, maternal and fetal. The maternal toxicity is comparable to that, already known in adults, with, however, some particularities at the time of labor and delivery. The fetal toxicity is mainly renal and cardiovascular, with the NSAI responsible for oligoamniosis and premature closure of the arterial canal of the fetus. on the other hand, the use of these molecules during breast-feeding does not seem source of adverse events, notably in the newborn. The various molecules Among the family of non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, indications and adverse events of the various molecules differ considerably. Moreover, whereas the majority of these molecules are non-selective, i.e. inhibiting the two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, new therapeutics, specifically inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2, are now available. Few studies have been published concerning their prescription during pregnancy and breast-feeding and their maternal and fetal side effects remain ignored by most of the practitioners.",

We overcome the lack of labelled data for supervised learning, by first developing a synthetic data generator of labelled TDs. We then use object detection techniques to identify rising and failing edges, OCR to recognise the text, and image processing algorithms to capture synchronisation patterns. Finally, we use semantic interpretation to analyse the extracted features and generate the associated formal specification. Our experiments on industrial TDs show high translation accuracy opening the way to more sophisticated requirements-extraction algorithms from pictures.",

The compounds tested showed low toxicity and a pharmacological profile similar to other NSAI substances on reducing the edema induced by carrageenan and contractions induced by phenyl-p-quinone; the most active compounds were 1 and 2. In the same way and as expected with these types of substances, the bleeding time increased. In the TPA-induced ear inflammation model, the three compounds showed a moderate reduction of edema, and 1 produced a significant increase in the reaction time against thermal painful stimuli in the tail immersion test. The results demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory, peripheral and central analgesic properties for 1, as well as antiedematose topical action and peripheral analgesic properties for 2 and 3.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge base question answering (KBQA) is an important task in Natural Language Processing. Existing approaches face significant challenges including complex question understanding, necessity for reasoning, and lack of large end-to-end training datasets. In this work, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Question Answering (NSQA), a modular KBQA system, that leverages (1) Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parses for task-independent question understanding; (2) a simple yet effective graph transformation approach to convert AMR parses into candidate logical queries that are aligned to the KB; (3) a pipeline-based approach which integrates multiple, reusable modules that are trained specifically for their individual tasks (semantic parser, entity and relationship linkers, and neuro-symbolic reasoner) and do not require end-to-end training data. NSQA achieves state-of-the-art performance on two prominent KBQA datasets based on DBpedia (QALD-9 and LC-QuAD 1.0). Furthermore, our analysis emphasizes that AMR is a powerful tool for KBQA systems.",

    "abstract": "Purpose of the study We report a series of 14 patients with a massive rotator cuff tear operated on with a deltoid flap according to Augereau's technique. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits of this technique using Constant's scoring system. The follow up is 40 months. Material and method 14 patients, mean age 59 years, with a total rotator cuff tear type III according to Gerber's classification were included. There was 13 total ruptures of the supra and infra spinatus tendon and one infraspinatus and subscapularis lesion. All the patients had shoulder pain, and the preoperative, Constant's score was 24.1/100. The diagnosis of the rotator cuff rupture was confirmed by X-rays, arthrography and ultra-sonography. 8 patients had a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evaluation. the surgical procedure was the technique described by Augereau, and three patients had a resection of the distal clavicle. One patient had a small piece of dacron to reinforce the suture of a very thin deltoid flap. All the patients had a immobilization in abduction and the rehabilitation programm began immediately. Results Results on pain were good : + 11.4 points according to Constant's score, but improvement strength (+ 0.7 point) or motion (+ 1 point) was not significative. Postoperative Constant's score was 46.9, ponderated score increased from 29.5 per cent to 57.5 per cent. Ten patients were very satisfied, 2 were satisfied and two were disappointed. One of them neaded shoulder arthrodesis; the other needed a new surgery to remove the piece of dacron, and was allayed with NSAI drugs. External rotation was slightly increased : + 2 point. Discussion These results are similar to others series on pain relief, but the results are poor on strength restauration and on shoulder motion. This technique is a heavy surgical procedure and results are not better than arthroscopic sub acromial decompression for massive rotator cuff tear.",

    "abstract": "Compositionality is thought to be a key component of language, and various compositional benchmarks have been developed to empirically probe the compositional generalization of existing sequence processing models. These benchmarks often highlight failures of existing models, but it is not clear why these models fail in this way. In this paper, we seek to theoretically understand the role the compositional structure of the models plays in these failures and how this structure relates to their expressivity and sample complexity. We propose a general neuro-symbolic definition of compositional functions and their compositional complexity. We then show how various existing general and special purpose sequence processing models (such as recurrent, convolution and attention-based ones) fit this definition and use it to analyze their compositional complexity. Finally, we provide theoretical guarantees for the expressivity and systematic generalization of compositional models that explicitly depend on our proposed definition and highlighting factors which drive poor empirical performance.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Breast cancer, particularly the hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) subtype, remains a major global health concern. Abemaciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, has shown promising results in treating advanced cases. This study comprehensively assesses the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in combination with endocrine therapy for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. A thorough literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov til December 2023. Inclusion criteria encompassed randomized controlled trials and retrospective cohort studies reporting on abemaciclib in approved doses, either as monotherapy or in combination. Outcome assessments included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), side effects/adverse effects (SE/AE), and overall survival (OS). Quality assessment utilized Cochrane's revised risk of bias tool and Newcastle-Ottawa scale. RESULTS: Pooled results of 22 studies involving 14,010 patients revealed that abemaciclib significantly improved PFS (hazard ratio=0.53; 95% CI: 0.48-0.59; P =0.00; I 2 =0%), ORR (risk ratio=2.31; 95% CI: 1.93-2.75; P =0.00; I 2 =0%), and OS (risk ratio=0.76 (95% CI: 0.65-0.87; P =0.001; I 2 =0%). However, abemaciclib increased the risk of adverse events in the fulvestrant and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) combinations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Abemaciclib, particularly in combination with fulvestrant, emerges as an effective therapeutic option for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer, improving PFS and OS. The higher toxicity profile warrants cautious use, especially in treatment-naive patients.",

The patient presented with septic shock and peritonitis by rectal perforation, followed by acute rectorrhagia. The endoscopic aspect evoked Crohn's disease with a recto-vaginal fistula. Progression was further complicated by two episodes of collapse because of acute rectorrhagia, requiring hemostasis colectomy and abdominal-perineal amputation. Conclusion The diagnosis retained was AINS-induced colitis complicated by acute colectasia on a fecaloma with recto-vaginal fistula.",

In BOLERO-2, patients with hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative (HER2(-)) advanced breast cancer recurring/progressing after a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive EVE (10 mg/day) + EXE (25 mg/day) or placebo (PBO) + EXE. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by local assessment. Overall, 137 patients received first-line EVE + EXE (n = 100) or PBO + EXE (n = 37). Median PFS by local investigator assessment nearly tripled to 11.5 months with EVE + EXE from 4.1 months with PBO + EXE (hazard ratio = 0.39; 95 % CI 0.25-0.62), while maintaining quality of life. This was confirmed by central assessment (15.2 vs 4.2 months; hazard ratio = 0.32; 95 % CI 0.18-0.57). The marked PFS improvement in patients receiving EVE + EXE as first-line therapy for disease recurrence during or after (neo)adjuvant NSAI therapy supports the efficacy of this combination in the first-line setting. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential benefit of early introduction of EVE + EXE in the management of HR(+), HER2(-) advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal patients.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous robotic navigation has become hotspot research, particularly in complex environments, where inefficient exploration can lead to inefficient navigation. Previous approaches often had a wide range of assumptions and prior knowledge. Adaptations of machine learning (ML) approaches, especially deep learning, play a vital role in the applications of navigation, detection, and prediction about robotic analysis. Further development is needed due to the fast growth of urban megacities. The main problem of training convergence time in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for mobile robot navigation refers to the amount of time it takes for the agent to learn an optimal policy through trial and error and is caused by the need to collect a large amount of data and computational demands of training deep neural networks. Meanwhile, the assumption of reward in DRL for navigation is problematic as it can be difficult or impossible to define a clear reward function in real-world scenarios, making it challenging to train the agent to navigate effectively. This paper proposes a neuro-symbolic approach that combine the strengths of deep reinforcement learning and fuzzy logic to address the challenges of deep reinforcement learning for mobile robot navigation in terms of training time and the assumption of reward by incorporating symbolic representations to guide the learning process, and inferring the underlying objectives of the task which is expected to reduce the training convergence time.",

    "abstract": "Many postmenopausal women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer (BC) receive nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs). Virtually all of them experience progression, but may still gain benefit from a different endocrine or targeted agent. We indirectly compare the results of trials on endocrine or targeted treatment in HR(+)/HER2(-) mBC patients who progressed after a prior NSAI therapy. Although with the limitations of any indirect comparison, evidence suggests that only the combination of everolimus and exemestane is associated with a prolonged progression-free survival and a more evident clinical benefit than its comparators. We speculate that prior NSAI therapy can 'per se' individuate patients eligible to everolimus. More robust data from head-to-head trials will provide more grounded evidence on this issue.",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have garnered significant attention for their efficiency in drug discovery, yet the synthesis of proposed molecules remains a challenge. Retrosynthetic planning, a part of computer-assisted synthesis planning, addresses this challenge by recursively decomposing molecules using symbolic rules and machine-trained scoring functions. However, current methods often treat each molecule independently, missing the opportunity to utilize shared synthesis patterns and repeat pathways, which may contribute from known synthesis routes to newly emerging, similar molecules, a notable challenge with AI-generated small molecules. Our investigation reveals reusable synthesis patterns that augment the reaction template library, resulting in progressively decreasing marginal inference time as the algorithm processes more molecules. Nevertheless, expanding the library enlarges the search space, necessitating investigation into methods for effectively prediction of reactions in retrosynthesis search. Inspired by human learning, our algorithm, akin to neurosymbolic programming, builds upon commonly used multi-step concepts such as cascade and complementary reactions and can evolve from practical experiences, enhancing the prediction model for fundamental and compositional reaction templates. The evolutionary process involves wake, abstraction, and dreaming phases, alternatively extending the reaction template library and refining models for more efficient retrosynthesis. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods, discovers chemistry patterns, and significantly reduces inference time in retrosynthetic planning for a group of similar molecules, showcasing its potential in validating results from generative models.Generative models rapidly generate many similar molecules but face synthesis challenges. Here, authors introduce an algorithm that leverages reusable synthesis patterns to improve retrosynthetic planning efficiency for such AI-generated molecules.",

    "abstract": "visual reasoning involves identifying abstract patterns embedded within composite images, considered a core competency of machine intelligence. Traditional neuro-symbolic methods often infer unknown objects through data fitting, without fully exploring the abstract patterns within composite images and the sequential sensitivity of visual sequences. This paper constructs a relation model with object-centric inductive biases, learning end-to-end multi-granular rule embeddings at different levels. Through a gating fusion module, the model incrementally integrates explicit representations of objects and abstract relationships. The model incorporates a relational bottleneck method from information theory, separating the input perceptual information from the embeddings of abstract representations, thereby restricting and differentiating feature processing to encourage relational comparisons and induce the extraction of abstract patterns. Furthermore, this paper bridges algebraic operations and machine reasoning through the relational bottleneck method, extracting common patterns of multi-visual objects by identifying invariant sequences within the relational bottleneck matrix. Experimental results on the I-RAVEN dataset demonstrate a total accuracy of 96.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baseline methods and exceeding human performance at 84.4%.",

We leverage a pre-trained neural network that is well adapted to tree and sub-tree processing, the Dependency Tree-LSTM, to learn the affect labels of dynamic targets, determined through symbolic rules, in natural language.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The commonsense natural language inference (CNLI) tasks aim to select the most likely follow-up statement to a contextual description of ordinary, everyday events and facts. Current approaches to transfer learning of CNLI models across tasks require many labeled data from the new task. This paper presents a way to reduce this need for additional annotated training data from the new task by leveraging symbolic knowledge bases, such as ConceptNet. We formulate a teacher-student framework for mixed symbolic-neural reasoning, with the large-scale symbolic knowledge base serving as the teacher and a trained CNLI model as the student. This hybrid distillation process involves two steps. The first step is a symbolic reasoning process. Given a collection of unlabeled data, we use an abductive reasoning framework based on Grenander's pattern theory to create weakly labeled data. Pattern theory is an energy-based graphical probabilistic framework for reasoning among random variables with varying dependency structures. In the second step, the weakly labeled data, along with a fraction of the labeled data, is used to transfer-learn the CNLI model into the new task. The goal is to reduce the fraction of labeled data required. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by using three publicly available datasets (OpenBookQA, SWAG, and HellaSWAG) and evaluating three CNLI models (BERT, LSTM, and ESIM) that represent different tasks. We show that, on average, we achieve 63% of the top performance of a fully supervised BERT model with no labeled data. With only 1,000 labeled samples, we can improve this performance to 72%. Interestingly, without training, the teacher mechanism itself has significant inference power. The pattern theory framework achieves 32.7% accuracy on OpenBookQA, outperforming transformer-based models such as GPT (26.6%), GPT-2 (30.2%), and BERT (27.1%) by a significant margin. We demonstrate that the framework can be generalized to successfully train neural CNLI models using knowledge distillation under unsupervised and semi-supervised learning settings. Our results show that it outperforms all unsupervised and weakly supervised baselines and some early supervised approaches, while offering competitive performance with fully supervised baselines. Additionally, we show that the abductive learning framework can be adapted for other downstream tasks, such as unsupervised semantic textual similarity, unsupervised sentiment classification, and zero-shot text classification, without significant modification to the framework. Finally, user studies show that the generated interpretations enhance its explainability by providing key insights into its reasoning mechanism.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause gastrointestinal damage both in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, in addition to their undesirable side effects on the pancreas. Meloxicam like all NSAIDs has damaging effects on the gastrointestinal tract including perforations, ulcers and bleeding. OBJECTIVE: The present work describes the effects of Gum acacia aqueous extract on the histology of intestine and enzymes of both intestine and Pancreas of albino rats treated with Meloxicam. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was performed on four groups of equally weighed male rats, each group included ten animals; the first group was received a diet containing 0.2 mg/kg bw meloxicam per day; the second was given 1gm Gum acacia per day in its diet; the third was given meloxicam followed by gum in the same doses per day; while the fourth group (control rats) was placed on a normal diet and water. All rats were received their diet for a period of 21 days. RESULTS: A considerable protective effect of Gum acacia aqueous extract on the histology of intestine of albino rats treated with meloxicam was recorded. In addition, the study displayed a significant increase (P < 0.001) in the intestinal enzymes; lipase, amylase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the 1(st) and 3(rd) groups animals while these enzymes were significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the 2(nd) group when compared with the 4(th) control group. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that Gum acacia provides a protection and defense against the harmful effects of meloxicam therapy used as one of the novel anti-Cox-1 and Cox-2 NSAIDs.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of the inducible isoform of cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX-2) spurred the search for anti-inflammatory agents devoid of the undesirable effects associated with classical NSAIDs. New chlorzoxazone ester prodrugs (6-8) of some acidic NSAIDs (1-3) were designed, synthesized and evaluated as mutual prodrugs with the aim of improving the therapeutic potency and retard the adverse effects of gastrointestinal origin. The structure of the synthesized mutual ester prodrugs (6-8) were confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR, mass spectroscopy (MS) and their purity was ascertained by TLC and elemental analyses. In vitro chemical stability revealed that the synthesized ester prodrugs (6-8) are chemically stable in hydrochloric acid buffer pH 1.2 as a non-enzymatic simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 as non-enzymatic simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). In 80% human plasma, the mutual prodrugs were found to be susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis at relatively faster rate (t(1/2) approximately 37 and 34 min for prodrugs 6 and 7, respectively). Mutual ester prodrugs (6-8) were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxation activities. Scanning electromicrographs of the stomach showed that the ester prodrugs induced very little irritancy in the gastric mucosa of rats after oral administration for 4days. In addition, docking of the mutual ester prodrugs (6-8) into COX-2 active site was conducted in order to predict the affinity and orientation of these prodrugs at the enzyme active site.",

    "year": "2025",
    "author": "Abraham Itzhak, Weinberg",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Image retrieval remains a challenging task due to the complex interaction between human visual perception, memory, and computational processes. Current image search engines often struggle to efficiently retrieve images based on natural language descriptions, as they rely on time-consuming preprocessing, tagging, and machine learning pipelines. This paper introduces the Human-Oriented Retrieval Search Engine for Images (HORSE), a novel approach that leverages neuro-symbolic indexing to improve image retrieval by focusing on human-oriented indexing. By integrating cognitive science insights with advanced computational techniques, HORSE enhances the retrieval process, making it more aligned with how humans perceive, store, and recall visual information. The neuro-symbolic framework combines the strengths of neural networks and symbolic reasoning, mitigating their individual limitations. The proposed system optimizes image retrieval, offering a more intuitive and efficient solution for users. We discuss the design and implementation of HORSE, highlight its potential applications in fields such as design error detection and knowledge management, and suggest future directions for research to further refine the system's metrics and capabilities.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new logical rule by incorporating Random Maximum k Satsifiability in the Hopfield neural network as a single model. The purpose is to combine the optimization capacity of the Hopfield neural network with non-systematic behaviour of the Random maximum k Satisfiability for classification problem. The energy function of a Hopfield neural network has been considered as a programming language for dynamics minimization mechanism. Several optimization and search problems associated with machine learning (ML), decision science (DS) and artificial intelligence (AI) have been expressed on the Hopfield neural network(HNN) optimally by modelling the problem into variables to minimize the objective function corresponding to Lyapunov energy function of the model. The computer simulation has been developed based on RANMAXkSAT logical rule in exploring the feasibility of the Hopfield neural network as a neuro-symbolic integration model for optimal classification problems. The perfromanmce of the proposed hybrid model has been compared with the existing models published in the literature in term of Global minimum ratio (zM), Fitness energy landscapes (FEL), Root Means square error (RMSE), Mean absolute errors and computation time (CPU). Hence, based on the experimental simulation results, it revealed that the RANMAXkSAT can optimally and effectively be represented in the Hopfield neural network (HNN) with 85.1 % classification accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The area of Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (Neurosymbolic AI) is rapidly developing and has become a popular research topic, encompassing sub-fields such as Neurosymbolic Deep Learning (Neurosymbolic DL) and Neurosymbolic Reinforcement Learning (Neurosymbolic RL). Compared to traditional learning methods, Neurosymbolic AI offers significant advantages by simplifying complexity and providing transparency and explainability. Reinforcement Learning(RL), a long-standing Artificial Intelligence(AI) concept that mimics human behavior using rewards and punishment, is a fundamental component of Neurosymbolic RL, a recent integration of the two fields that has yielded promising results. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the emerging field of Neurosymbolic RL by conducting a literature survey. Our evaluation focuses on the three components that constitute Neurosymbolic RL: neural, symbolic, and RL. We categorize works based on the role played by the neural and symbolic parts in RL, into three taxonomies:Learning for Reasoning, Reasoning for Learning and Learning-Reasoning. These categories are further divided into sub-categories based on their applications. Furthermore, we analyze the RL components of each research work, including the state space, action space, policy module, and RL algorithm. Additionally, we identify research opportunities and challenges in various applications within this dynamic field.",

    "abstract": "Block-based visual programming environments are increasingly used to introduce computing concepts to beginners. Given that programming tasks are open-ended and conceptual, novice students often struggle when learning in these environments. AI-driven programming tutors hold great promise in automatically assisting struggling students, and need several components to realize this potential. We investigate the crucial component of student modeling, in particular, the ability to automatically infer students' misconceptions for predicting (synthesizing) their behavior. We introduce a novel benchmark, StudentSyn, centered around the following challenge: For a given student, synthesize the student's attempt on a new target task after observing the student's attempt on a fixed reference task. This challenge is akin to that of program synthesis; however, instead of synthesizing a solution (i.e., program an expert would write), the goal here is to synthesize a student attempt (i.e., program that a given student would write). We first show that human experts (TutorSS) can achieve high performance on the benchmark, whereas simple baselines perform poorly. Then, we develop two neuro/symbolic techniques (NeurSS and SymSS) in a quest to close this gap with TutorSS.",

    "abstract": "We introduce LLM-ARC, a neuro-symbolic framework designed to enhance the logical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), by combining them with an Automated Reasoning Critic (ARC). LLM-ARC employs an Actor-Critic method where the LLM Actor generates declarative logic programs along with tests for semantic correctness, while the Automated Reasoning Critic evaluates the code, runs the tests and provides feedback on test failures for iterative refinement. Implemented using Answer Set Programming (ASP), LLM-ARC achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.32% on the FOLIO benchmark which tests complex logical reasoning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over LLM-only baselines, highlighting the importance of logic test generation and iterative self-refinement. We achieve our best result using a fully automated self-supervised training loop where the Actor is trained on end-to-end dialog traces with Critic feedback. We discuss potential enhancements and provide a detailed error analysis, showcasing the robustness and efficacy of LLM-ARC for complex natural language reasoning tasks.",

    "abstract": "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI has revolutionized natural language applications across various domains. However, high-stakes decision-making tasks in fields such as medical, legal and finance require a level of precision, comprehensiveness, and logical consistency that pure LLM or Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) approaches often fail to deliver. At Elemental Cognition (EC), we have developed a neuro-symbolic AI platform to tackle these problems. The platform integrates fine-tuned LLMs for knowledge extraction and alignment with a robust symbolic reasoning engine for logical inference, planning and interactive constraint solving. We describe Cora, a Collaborative Research Assistant built on this platform, that is designed to perform complex research and discovery tasks in high-stakes domains. This paper discusses the multi-step inference challenges inherent in such domains, critiques the limitations of existing LLM-based methods, and demonstrates how Cora's neuro-symbolic approach effectively addresses these issues. We provide an overview of the system architecture, key algorithms for knowledge extraction and formal reasoning, and present preliminary evaluation results that highlight Cora's superior performance compared to well-known LLM and RAG baselines.",

These circuits were initially proposed as compiled objects, meant to facilitate logical and probabilistic reasoning, as they permit various types of inference to be performed in linear-time and a feed-forward fashion like neural networks. In more recent years, the role of tractable circuits has significantly expanded as they became a computational and semantical backbone for some approaches that aim to integrate knowledge, reasoning and learning. In this article, we review the foundations of tractable circuits and some associated milestones, while focusing on their core properties and techniques that make them particularly useful for the broad aims of neuro-symbolic AI.",

There has been an increasing influx of work on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in order to disentangle what is meant and expected by XAI.

In this paper, we discuss why techniques integrating connectionist and symbolic paradigms are the most efficient solutions to produce explanations for non-technical users and we propose a reasoning model, based on definitions by Doran et al. [2017] (arXiv:1710.00794) to explain a neural network's decision. We use this explanation in order to correct bias in the network's decision rationale. We accompany this model with an example of its potential use, based on the image captioning method in Burns et al. [2018] (arXiv:1803.09797).",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Every 90 seconds, a woman dies of complications related to pregnancy and childbirth, resulting in more than 340,000 maternal deaths a year. Antenatal care (ANC) and postnatal care (PNC) are significant determinants of maternal health and, particularly, safe motherhood. Antenatal care is an important predictor of safe delivery and provides health information and services that can improve the health of women and infants. mHealth broadly encompasses the use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies as they are integrated within increasingly mobile and wireless health care delivery systems. This study aimed at assessing the acceptable implementation modalities of mHealth intervention on pregnant Women in Dschang health district, West Region of Cameroon.ng ba. METHODS: This was a cross sectional descriptive study in the Dschang health district, West region of Cameroon. Key informants were all pregnant women from 18 years and above and a total of 372 pregnant women were included. This study was carried out from March to July 2017. RESULTS: Majority of the women, that is, 252(67.74%) were married, 117(31.45%) declaredtheir status as being single, while 3(0.81%) were devorced. Out of the 335 women that declared wanting an mHealth intervention, 41.79% of this number preferred SMS texts in the afternoon, 111(33.13%) in the evening, 46(13.73%) anytime and 38(11.34%) in the morning hours. A total of 83.33% women confirmed using telephone services. CONCLUSION: This study reveals that cell phones would be the acceptable medium of providing pregnancy and postpartum support to women in the Dschang health district. This is justified by the fact that a vast majority of women interviewed had access to a cell phone and referred to it as their desired and accepted means of communication.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Chronic non-bacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) is a rare autoinflammatory bone disorder which mainly affects children and young adolescents. In this study, we report our single-center experience with pediatric CNO patients.Method: Children diagnosed with CNO at the Department of Pediatric Rheumatology of Hacettepe University between November 2006 and July 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. The demographics, clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging modalities, concomitant diseases, and treatments were recorded. Diagnostic delay was defined as the time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis.Results: A total of 48 patients (52.1% male) with a median age of 13.7 (minimum-maximum: 3.3-20.4) years were included. Local bone pain was the most frequent symptom (72. 9%), followed by arthralgia (52. 1%), limping or difficulty in walking (43. 8%), and back pain (33.3%). Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (52. 1%) and high C-reactive protein levels (43. 8%) were the most frequently observed laboratory abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (regional MRI in 87.5% and whole-body MRI in 66.7% of patients) was widely used in the diagnosis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were used in all patients and six patients (12. 5%) achieved complete clinical remission with NSAI Ds alone. Methotrexate (MTX) (80. 9%), biological agents (7. 1%), and pamidronate (11. 9%) were used as the second-line treatment. Also, 26.4% of patients achieved clinical remission with MTX. Biological treatment was required in a total of 27 patients (56.2%).Conclusion: Local bone pain is a warning sign for CNO diagnosis. Complete clinical remission can be achieved in CNO patients with an escalating anti-inflammatory treatment, having NSAI Ds in one end, and biological drugs and bisphosphonates on the other end of the spectrum.",

We define the verification problem for these systems against a bounded fragment of alternating-time temporal logic. We translate the verification problem on bounded traces into the feasibility problem of mixed integer linear programs and show the soundness and completeness of the translation. We show that the lower bound of the verification problem is PSPACE and the upper bound is coNEXPTIME. We present a tool implementing the compilation and evaluate the experimental results obtained on a complex scenario of multiple aircraft operating a recently proposed prototype for air-traffic collision avoidance.",

    "author": "Akoachere, J. F. and Nsai, F. S. and Ndip, R. N.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Buruli ulcer (BU) is a neglected tropical disease affecting the skin, tissues and in some cases the bones, caused by the environmental pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcerans). Its mode of transmission is still elusive. Delayed treatment may cause irreversible disabilities with consequent social and economic impacts on the victim. Socio-cultural beliefs, practices and attitudes in endemic communities have been shown to influence timely treatment causing disease management, prevention and control a great challenge. An assessment of these factors in endemic localities is important in designing successful intervention strategies. Considering this, we assessed the knowledge, attitude and practices regarding BU in three endemic localities in the South West region, Cameroon to highlight existing misconceptions that need to be addressed to enhance prompt treatment and facilitate effective prevention and control. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cross-sectional study was executed in three BU endemic health districts. Using qualitative and quantitative approaches we surveyed 320 randomly selected household heads, interviewed BU patients and conducted three focus group discussions (FGDs) to obtain information on awareness, beliefs, treatment, and attitudes towards victims. The influence of socio-demographic factors on these variables was investigated. RESULTS: Respondents (84.4%) had a good knowledge of BU though only 65% considered it a health problem while 49.4% believed it is contagious. Socio-demographic factors significantly (P<0.05) influenced awareness of BU, knowledge and practice on treatment and attitudes towards victims. Although the majority of respondents stated the hospital as the place for appropriate treatment, FGDs and some BU victims preferred witchdoctors/herbalists and prayers, and considered the hospital as the last option. We documented beliefs about the disease which could delay treatment. CONCLUSION: Though we are reporting a high level of knowledge of BU, there exist fallacies about BU and negative attitudes towards victims in communities studied. Efforts towards disease eradication must first of all target these misconceptions.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we introduce application of Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) for predicting the impact strength of additive manufactured polylactic acid (PLA) components, representing the first-ever use of NSAI in the domain of additive manufacturing. The NSAI model amalgamates the advantages of neural networks and symbolic AI, offering a more robust and accurate prediction than traditional machine learning techniques. Experimental data was collected and synthetically augmented to 1000 data points, enhancing the model's precision. The Neurosymbolic model was developed using a neural network architecture comprising input, two hidden layers, and an output layer, followed by a decision tree regressor representing the symbolic component. The model's performance was benchmarked against a Simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model by assessing mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) values for both training and validation datasets. The results reveal that the Neurosymbolic model surpasses the Simple ANN model, attaining lower MSE and higher R2 values for both training and validation sets. This innovative application of the Neurosymbolic approach in estimating the impact strength of additive manufactured PLA components underscores its potential for optimizing the additive manufacturing process. Future research could investigate further refinements to the Neurosymbolic model, extend its application to other materials and additive manufacturing processes, and incorporate real-time monitoring and control for enhanced process optimization.",

    "abstract": "Mobile robot navigation has been a very popular topic of practice among researchers since a while. With the goal of enhancing the autonomy in mobile robot navigation, numerous algorithms (traditional AI-based, swarm intelligence-based, self-learning-based) have been built and implemented independently, and also in blended manners. Nevertheless, the problem of efficient autonomous robot navigation persists in multiple degrees due to the limitation of these algorithms. The lack of knowledge on the implemented techniques and their shortcomings act as a hindrance to further development on this topic. This is why an extensive study on the previously implemented algorithms, their applicability, their weaknesses as well as their potential needs to be conducted in order to assess how to improve mobile robot navigation performance. In this review paper, a comprehensive review of mobile robot navigation algorithms has been conducted. The findings suggest that, even though the self-learning algorithms require huge amounts of training data and have the possibility of learning erroneous behavior, they possess huge potential to overcome challenges rarely addressed by the other traditional algorithms. The findings also insinuate that in the domain of machine learning-based algorithms, integration of knowledge representation with a neuro-symbolic approach has the capacity to improve the accuracy and performance of self-robot navigation training by a significant margin.",

    "abstract": "Many computational tasks can be naturally expressed as a composition of a DNN followed by a program written in a traditional programming language or an API call to an LLM. We call such composites neural programs and focus on the problem of learning the DNN parameters when the training data consist of end-to-end input-output labels for the composite. When the program is written in a differentiable logic programming language, techniques from neurosymbolic learning are applicable, but in general, the learning for neural programs requires estimating the gradients of black-box components. We present an algorithm for learning neural programs, called ISED, that only relies on input-output samples of black-box components. For evaluation, we introduce new benchmarks that involve calls to modern LLMs such as GPT-4 and also consider benchmarks from the neurosymbolic learning literature. Our evaluation shows that for the latter benchmarks, ISED has comparable performance to state-of-the-art neurosymbolic frameworks. For the former, we use adaptations of prior work on gradient approximations of black-box components as a baseline, and show that ISED achieves comparable accuracy but in a more data- and sample-efficient manner.",

    "abstract": "Background : Previous studies showed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs suppressed prostaglandin synthesis and were able to prevent adhesion formation following surgical trauma to the peritoneum. The selective suppression inflammatory cascade may prevent adhesion formation. Therefore, we planned this study to experimentally evaluate the effects of Rofecoxib, the selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitor, in postoperative intraperitoneal adhesions in an animal model. Methods : Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups of 10. All rats underwent midline laparotomy under ketamine anaesthesia (25 mg/kg im). In group I (n = 10), the sham operation group (SG); abdominal walls were closed without any process after 2 minutes. In Group 2 (n = 10), the control group (CG); standard serosal damage was constituted and the abdominal wall was closed. In group 3 (n = 10), the COX-2 group (COXG), after serosal damage, the abdominal wall was closed. A 12 mg/kg/day dose of was given orally to the rats during one week. On the 711, postoperative day, all rats were sacrificed and intra-abdominal adhesions were evaluated both macroscopically and microscopically. Results : Macroscopically, no serious adhesion formations were seen in the SG. Multiple adhesion formations of the CG were significantly more than those of the SG (p < 0.0001). It was determined that adhesions of the COXG diminished (p < 0.0001) when macromorphological adhesion scale results of the COXG were compared with those of the CG. The adhesion scores of the CG were compared microscopically with those of the COXG and granulation tissue formation and fibrosis in the COXG were found to be significantly less than those of the CG (respectively p = 0.002, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: We were of the opinion that Rofecoxib, the selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, was effective in the prevention of postoperative peritoneal adhesions.",

    "abstract": "In the recent past, there has been a growing interest in Neural-Symbolic Integration frameworks, i.e., hybrid systems that integrate connectionist and symbolic approaches to obtain the best of both worlds. In a previous work, we proposed KENN (Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks), a Neural-Symbolic architecture that injects prior logical knowledge into a neural network by adding a new final layer which modifies the initial predictions accordingly to the knowledge. Among the advantages of this strategy, there is the inclusion of clause weights, learnable parameters that represent the strength of the clauses, meaning that the model can learn the impact of each clause on the final predictions. As a special case, if the training data contradicts a constraint, KENN learns to ignore it, making the system robust to the presence of wrong knowledge. In this paper, we propose an extension of KENN for relational data. To evaluate this new extension, we tested it with different learning configurations on Citeseer, a standard dataset for Collective Classification. The results show that KENN is capable of increasing the performances of the underlying neural network even in the presence relational data, outperforming other two notable methods that combine learning with logic.",

    "author": "Daniele, Alessandro and Campari, Tommaso and Malhotra, Sagar and Luciano, Serafini",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) integration combines symbolic reasoning with Neural Networks (NNs) for tasks requiring perception and reasoning. Most NeSy systems rely on continuous relaxation of logical knowledge, and no discrete decisions are made within the model pipeline. Furthermore, these methods assume that the symbolic rules are given. In this paper, we propose Deep Symbolic Learning (DSL), a NeSy system that learns NeSy-functions, i.e., the composition of a (set of) perception functions which map continuous data to discrete symbols, and a symbolic function over the set of symbols. DSL learns simultaneously the perception and symbolic functions while being trained only on their composition (NeSy-function). The key novelty of DSL is that it can create internal (interpretable) symbolic representations and map them to perception inputs within a differentiable NN learning pipeline. The created symbols are automatically selected to generate symbolic functions that best explain the data. We provide experimental analysis to substantiate the efficacy of DSL in simultaneously learning perception and symbolic functions.",

    "abstract": "Computational context understanding refers to an agent's ability to fuse disparate sources of information for decision-making and is, therefore, generally regarded as a prerequisite for sophisticated machine reasoning capabilities, such as in artificial intelligence (AI). Data-driven and knowledge-driven methods are two classical techniques in the pursuit of such machine sense-making capability. However, while data-driven methods seek to model the statistical regularities of events by making observations in the real-world, they remain difficult to interpret and they lack mechanisms for naturally incorporating external knowledge. Conversely, knowledge-driven methods, combine structured knowledge bases, perform symbolic reasoning based on axiomatic principles, and are more interpretable in their inferential processing; however, they often lack the ability to estimate the statistical salience of an inference. To combat these issues, we propose the use of hybrid",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "High-level reasoning can be defined as the capability to generalize over knowledge acquired via experience, and to exhibit robust behavior in novel situations. Such form of reasoning is a basic skill in humans, who seamlessly use it in a broad spectrum of tasks, from language communication to decision making in complex situations. When it manifests itself in understanding and manipulating the everyday world of objects and their interactions, we talk about common sense or commonsense reasoning. State-of-the-art AI systems don't possess such capability: for instance, Large Language Models have recently become popular by demonstrating remarkable fluency in conversing with humans, but they still make trivial mistakes when probed for commonsense competence; on a different level, performance degradation outside training data prevents self-driving vehicles to safely adapt to unseen scenarios, a serious and unsolved problem that limits the adoption of such technology. In this paper we propose to enable high-level reasoning in AI systems by integrating cognitive architectures with external neuro-symbolic components. We illustrate a hybrid framework centered on ACT-R and we discuss the role of generative models in recent and future applications.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) achieve astonishing results on a wide range of tasks. However, their formal reasoning ability still lags behind. A promising approach is Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning. It works by using LLMs as translators from natural to formal languages and symbolic solvers for deriving correct results. Still, it remains unclear what the contributing factors to the success of Neurosymbolic LLM reasoning are. This paper shows that one important factor is the choice of the formal language. By comparing 4 formal languages on 3 datasets over 6 LLMs, we show that the choice of formal language affects both the syntactic and the semantic reasoning capability. Thereby, we introduce the intermediate language challenge, which is the challenge of picking a suitable formal language for neurosymbolic reasoning. Further, we compare the effects of using different in-context-learning examples in an ablation study. We conclude that on average, context-aware encodings help LLMs to reason, while there is no apparent effect of using comments or markdown syntax.",

In that study, evidence is reported of generalization behavior by 7-month-old infants, using an Artificial Language Learning paradigm. The authors fail to replicate this behavior in neural network simulations, and claim that this failure reveals inherent limitations of a whole class of neural networks: those that do not incorporate symbolic operations. A great number of computational models were proposed in follow-up studies, fuelling a heated debate about what is required for a model to generalize. Twenty years later, this debate is still not settled. In this paper, we review a large number of the proposed models. We present a critical analysis of those models, in terms of how they contribute to answer the most relevant questions raised by the experiment. After identifying which aspects require further research, we propose a list of desiderata for advancing our understanding on generalization.",

At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.",

    "year": "2025",
    "author": "Ali, Forootani",

    "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning and optimization are fundamental to artificial intelligence and computational problem-solving. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved AI-driven mathematical reasoning, theorem proving, and optimization techniques. This survey explores the evolution of mathematical problem-solving in AI, from early statistical learning approaches to modern deep learning and transformer-based methodologies. We review the capabilities of pretrained language models and LLMs in performing arithmetic operations, complex reasoning, theorem proving, and structured symbolic computation. A key focus is on how LLMs integrate with optimization and control frameworks, including mixed-integer programming, linear quadratic control, and multi-agent optimization strategies. We examine how LLMs assist in problem formulation, constraint generation, and heuristic search, bridging theoretical reasoning with practical applications. We also discuss enhancement techniques such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning, instruction tuning, and tool-augmented methods that improve LLM's problem-solving performance. Despite their progress, LLMs face challenges in numerical precision, logical consistency, and proof verification. Emerging trends such as hybrid neural-symbolic reasoning, structured prompt engineering, and multi-step self-correction aim to overcome these limitations. Future research should focus on interpretability, integration with domain-specific solvers, and improving the robustness of AI-driven decision-making. This survey offers a comprehensive review of the current landscape and future directions of mathematical reasoning and optimization with LLMs, with applications across engineering, finance, and scientific research.",

    "abstract": "The prevailing approaches in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are often hampered by issues such as high resource consumption, significant computational demands, and poor interpretability. Furthermore, these systems generally struggle to identify novel, rapidly changing cyber threats. This paper delves into the potential of incorporating Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) into NIDS, combining deep learning's data-driven strengths with symbolic AI's logical reasoning to tackle the dynamic challenges in cybersecurity, which also includes detailed NSAI techniques introduction for cyber professionals to explore the potential strengths of NSAI in NIDS. The inclusion of NSAI in NIDS marks potential advancements in both the detection and interpretation of intricate network threats, benefiting from the robust pattern recognition of neural networks and the interpretive prowess of symbolic reasoning. By analyzing network traffic data types and machine learning architectures, we illustrate NSAI's distinctive capability to offer more profound insights into network behavior, thereby improving both detection performance and the adaptability of the system. This merging of technologies not only enhances the functionality of traditional NIDS but also sets the stage for future developments in building more resilient, interpretable, and dynamic defense mechanisms against advanced cyber threats. The continued progress in this area is poised to transform NIDS into a system that is both responsive to known threats and anticipatory of emerging, unseen ones.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Camurati-Engelmann disease (CED), also known as progressive diaphyseal dysplasia, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal thickening of the long bones' diaphysis. This condition is caused by mutations in the transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB-1) gene and is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Patients with CED often present with symptoms such as chronic bone pain, muscle weakness, fatigue, and difficulty walking. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 30-month-old boy who presented with gait abnormality. Initially, toxic synovitis was considered, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAİ) treatment was administered. The patient did not respond to NSAİ treatment. Direct radiographs showed diaphyseal thickening, especially in the long bones. Radiologically, CED was suspected, and clinical exome sequencing identified a TGFB-1: c1121C > G (Pro374Arg) heterozygous mutation, which was interpreted as a possible pathogenic variant for CED. A clinical, radiologic, and genetic diagnosis of CED was made. CONCLUSION: Due to its rarity and variable clinical presentation, the diagnosis of CED can be challenging and often requires a high index of suspicion. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for managing symptoms and improving patients' quality of life.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Objective: Although Achilles tendon ruptures can have many causes, they are known to develop most commonly with trauma. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and low doses of corticosteroids are used in the medical treatment of tendon ruptures. Ellagic acid (EA), which also has an anti-inflammatory effect, has been reported to show its effect via cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibition as well. The effects of EA and diclofenac sodium on tendon healing were compared in this study. Methods: We used a total of 18 male New Zealand rabbits in 3 groups with 6 in each. The study was performed under general anesthesia with a xylazine-ketamine combination. After a defect was created in the right Achilles tendon of all the rabbits, group I was administered diclofenac sodium and group II was administered EA for 1 week, whereas the control group (group III) was not administered anything. Postoperative follow-up was provided for all groups. Results: Euthanasia was performed in all subjects at the end of the eighth week, and the tendons were compared in terms of macroscopic and histopathologic features and tensile resistance. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the tensile resistance Newton values of group I and group II, these values were higher than in the control group, and the NSAI group values were statistically significantly higher than in the control group. Conclusions: We concluded that EA and NSAIs could be effective in the recovery of tendon integrity and tensile strength and increasing the movement capacity in pathology caused by tendon damage because of their anti-inflammatory features.",

    "author": "Allen, Bradley P. and Ilievski, Filip",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Knowledge engineering is the process of creating and maintaining knowledge-producing systems. Throughout the history of computer science and AI, knowledge engineering workflows have been widely used given the importance of high-quality knowledge for reliable intelligent agents. Meanwhile, the scope of knowledge engineering, as apparent from its target tasks and use cases, has been shifting, together with its paradigms such as expert systems, semantic web, and language modeling. The intended use cases and supported user requirements between these paradigms have not been analyzed globally, as new paradigms often satisfy prior pain points while possibly introducing new ones. The recent abstraction of systemic patterns into a boxology provides an opening for aligning the requirements and use cases of knowledge engineering with the systems, components, and software that can satisfy them best. This paper proposes a vision of harmonizing the best practices in the field of knowledge engineering by leveraging the software engineering methodology of creating reference architectures. We describe how a reference architecture can be iteratively designed and implemented to associate user needs with recurring systemic patterns, building on top of existing knowledge engineering workflows and boxologies. We provide a six-step roadmap that can enable the development of such an architecture, providing an initial design and outcome of the definition of architectural scope, selection of information sources, and analysis. We expect that following through on this vision will lead to well-grounded reference architectures for knowledge engineering, will advance the ongoing initiatives of organizing the neurosymbolic knowledge engineering space, and will build new links to the software architectures and data science communities.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Palliative treatment options for HR + HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) patients have increased, but data is lacking about the optimal treatment sequence. We used real-world data from a comprehensive cancer center to describe applied treatment sequences and we determined treatment-related and survival outcomes. METHODS: Patients aged 18 years and older with HR + HER2- ABC treated with systemic treatment were included in this historic cohort study. Sequential treatment schedules, time to treatment discontinuation, time to chemotherapy, and overall survival (OS) were determined, stratified by first-line treatment. RESULTS: 202 patients were included. They received a total of 650 treatment lines (median 3; range: 1-11). 91 (45%), 25 (12%), 24 (12%), 28 (14%), 22 (11%) and 12 (6%) patients started first-line treatment with non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI), NSAI + cyclin dependent kinase 4/6-inhibitors (CDK4/6i), fulvestrant + CDK4/6i, tamoxifen, chemotherapy and other treatment, respectively. 10, 13, and 14 different treatment regimens were given in first, second and third-line, respectively. Of the patients who started first-line NSAI monotherapy (n = 91), 3 (3%) died before receiving second-line treatment. CONCLUSION: In this real-world cohort, we observed a wide variety of different treatment sequences applied in daily clinical practice, some of which were in discordance with the current guidelines. Fear that patients may never get around to treatment with CDK4/6i if a patient did not start with a CDK4/6i was not supported by our study results.",

    "abstract": "Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) systems have gained huge interest in recent years, with reference expression comprehension being one of the main challenges. Traditionally human-machine interaction has been mostly limited to speech and visual modalities. However, to allow for more freedom in interaction, recent works have proposed the integration of additional modalities, such as gestures in HMI systems. We consider such an HMI system with pointing gestures and construct a table-top object picking scenario inside a simulated virtual reality (VR) environment to collect data. Previous works for such a task have used deep neural networks to classify the referred object, which lacks transparency. In this work, we propose an interpretable and compositional model, crucial to building robust HMI systems for real-world application, based on a neuro-symbolic approach to tackle this task. Finally we also show the generalizability of our model on unseen environments and report the results.",

    "abstract": "Data increasingly abounds, but distilling their underlying relationships down to something interpretable remains challenging. One approach is genetic programming, which `symbolically regresses' a data set down into an equation. However, symbolic regression (SR) faces the issue of requiring training from scratch for each new dataset. To generalize across all datasets, deep learning techniques have been applied to SR. These networks, however, are only able to be trained using a symbolic objective: NN-generated and target equations are symbolically compared. But this does not consider the predictive power of these equations, which could be measured by a behavioral objective that compares the generated equation's predictions to actual data. Here we introduce a method that combines gradient descent and evolutionary computation to yield neural networks that minimize the symbolic and behavioral errors of the equations they generate from data. As a result, these evolved networks are shown to generate more symbolically and behaviorally accurate equations than those generated by networks trained by state-of-the-art gradient based neural symbolic regression methods. We hope this method suggests that evolutionary algorithms, combined with gradient descent, can improve SR results by yielding equations with more accurate form and function.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Oral candidiasis is one of the most common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patient and it is caused by Candida species. The low absolute CD4+T-lymphocyte count has traditionally been cited as the greatest risk factor for the development of Oral Candidiasis. The aim of this study was to identify Candida species isolated from the oral cavity of HIV/AIDS patients, to determine their in vitro antifungal susceptibility and to investigate the possible risk factors associated with oral candidiasis. METHODS: This was a hospital based cross sectional study that was carried out for a period of 3 months amongst HIV/AIDS patients in Kumba District Hospital, whether on HAART or not. Mouth swabs were collected from 378 participants using sterile cotton wool swabs and 5ml venous blood were collected for determination of CD4 cell. Candida species were isolated and identified. Antifungal sensitivity testing was performed using modified kirby-bauer susceptibility testing technique. RESULTS: Candida species were present in 42.86% of the samples and Candida albicans was the most prevalent (60.2%) amongst the six Candida isolates identified, followed by Candida glabrata (16.9%), Candida krusei (12.3%), Candida tropicalis (6.4%), Candida parapsilosis (2.3%) and Candida pseudotropicalis (1.8%). Pregnancy, oral hygiene and antibiotic usage were significantly associated with oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients (P<0.05). Oral candidiasis was mostly frequent in HIV/AIDS patients between 21-40 years. A CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/μl was a significant risk factor for acquiring oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients (P<0.001). Nystatin was the most sensitive drug (83.6%) meanwhile ketonazole was the most resistant drug (29.2%), followed by fluconazole (24.6%) to all oral Candida isolates. CONCLUSION: Oral Candida colonization occurs more frequently in HIV/AIDS patients and the is a need for the government to implement regular checks for opportunistic infections in HIV/AIDS patients, including oral candidiasis in HIV/AIDS patients to monitor disease progression and prevent subsequent complications such as candidemia and diarrhea.",

    "abstract": "Continual learning is crucial for creating AI agents that can learn and improve themselves autonomously. A primary challenge in continual learning is to learn new tasks without losing previously learned knowledge. Current continual learning methods primarily focus on enabling a neural network with mechanisms that mitigate forgetting effects. Inspired by the two distinct systems in the human brain, System 1 and System 2, we propose a Neuro-Symbolic Brain-Inspired Continual Learning (NeSyBiCL) framework that incorporates two subsystems to solve continual learning: A neural network model responsible for quickly adapting to the most recent task, together with a symbolic reasoner responsible for retaining previously acquired knowledge from previous tasks. Moreover, we design an integration mechanism between these components to facilitate knowledge transfer from the symbolic reasoner to the neural network. We also introduce two compositional continual learning benchmarks and demonstrate that NeSyBiCL is effective and leads to superior performance compared to continual learning methods that merely rely on neural architectures to address forgetting.",

    "abstract": "Bee venom (BV) therapy is the therapeutic application of honey bee venom for the treatment of various diseases. In order to apply BV to the skin, as a topical formulation, chitosan (Chit) films were fabricated. Bee venom could be loaded at 6% w/w of polymer in the films. The morphology and mechanical properties, including bioadhesive properties, surface pH primary skin irritation test, microbial penetration, tensile strength, percentage of elongation and swelling ratio, were evaluated. According to the mechanical properties of the films, 6% bee venom-chitosan (6% BV-Chit) films were superior to both chitosan free film (Chit-F) and other films containing lower concentrations of BV. Accordingly, chitosan films containing 6% BV were the subject of further pharmacological and biological tests. The wound healing activities of Chit-F and 6% BV-Chit films were evaluated using excision, round section, full thickness skin wound model in rats. In addition, the anti-inflammatory effects of Chit-F and 6% BV-Chit films were studied in rats using the rat paw edema thickness method. Furthermore, serum prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was determined to investigate the possible mechanism for the anti-inflammatory activity of this topical formulation. The results show that both Chit-F and 6% BV-Chit films accelerated the wound healing compared to untreated rats. As for the anti-inflammatory effects. 6% BV-Chit films had greater potency compared to that of Chit-F and this effect was comparable to that of the standard NSAI, indomethacin. Moreover, the elevated serum PGE2 was significantly reduced in a descending order as follows: indomethacin >6% BV-Chit > Chit-F. These results suggest that the combination of would healing ability of chitosan together with the anti-inflammatory activity of BV in one topical formulation provide a promising therapy for rapid complete sterile would healing, in addition to an anti-inflammatory activity for topical inflammatory lesions.",

    "abstract": "Humans interact with the environment using a combination of perception - transforming sensory inputs from their environment into symbols, and cognition - mapping symbols to knowledge about the environment for supporting abstraction, reasoning by analogy, and long-term planning. Human perception-inspired machine perception, in the context of AI, refers to large-scale pattern recognition from raw data using neural networks trained using self-supervised learning objectives such as next-word prediction or object recognition. On the other hand, machine cognition encompasses more complex computations, such as using knowledge of the environment to guide reasoning, analogy, and long-term planning. Humans can also control and explain their cognitive functions. This seems to require the retention of symbolic mappings from perception outputs to knowledge about their environment. For example, humans can follow and explain the guidelines and safety constraints driving their decision-making in safety-critical applications such as healthcare, criminal justice, and autonomous driving. This article introduces the rapidly emerging paradigm of Neurosymbolic AI combines neural networks and knowledge-guided symbolic approaches to create more capable and flexible AI systems. These systems have immense potential to advance both algorithm-level (e.g., abstraction, analogy, reasoning) and application-level (e.g., explainable and safety-constrained decision-making) capabilities of AI systems.",

This method systematically enhances the model's ability to comprehend and execute the provided directives. Despite these advancements, LLMs still face challenges in consistently interpreting complex, multi-step instructions and generalizing them to novel tasks, which are essential for broader applicability in real-world scenarios. This article explores why neurosymbolic AI offers a better path to enhance the instructability of LLMs. We explore the use a symbolic task planner to decompose high-level instructions into structured tasks, a neural semantic parser to ground these tasks into executable actions, and a neuro-symbolic executor to implement these actions while dynamically maintaining an explicit representation of state.

This work proposes a concept for this user-centered hybrid learning paradigm that focuses on robotic surgical situations. While most recent research focused on hybrid learning for non-robotic and some generic robotic domains, little work focuses on surgical robotics.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have enabled autonomous systems to perceive and comprehend objects and their environments in a perceptual subsymbolic manner. These systems can now perform object detection, sensor data fusion, and language understanding tasks. However, there is a growing need to enhance these systems to understand objects and their environments more conceptually and symbolically. It is essential to consider both the explicit teaching provided by humans (e.g., describing a situation or explaining how to act) and the implicit teaching obtained by observing human behavior (e.g., through the system's sensors) to achieve this level of powerful artificial intelligence. Thus, the system must be designed with multimodal input and output capabilities to support implicit and explicit interaction models. In this position paper, we argue for considering both types of inputs, as well as human-in-the-loop and incremental learning techniques, for advancing the field of artificial intelligence and enabling autonomous systems to learn like humans. We propose several hypotheses and design guidelines and highlight a use case from related work to achieve this goal.",

    "abstract": "Neural Module Networks (NMNs) have been quite successful in incorporating explicit reasoning as learnable modules in various question answering tasks, including the most generic form of numerical reasoning over text in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC). However, to achieve this, contemporary NMNs need strong supervision in executing the query as a specialized program over reasoning modules and fail to generalize to more open-ended settings without such supervision. Hence we propose Weakly-Supervised Neuro-Symbolic Module Network (WNSMN) trained with answers as the sole supervision for numerical reasoning based MRC. It learns to execute a noisy heuristic program obtained from the dependency parsing of the query, as discrete actions over both neural and symbolic reasoning modules and trains it end-to-end in a reinforcement learning framework with discrete reward from answer matching. On the numerical-answer subset of DROP, WNSMN out-performs NMN by 32% and the reasoning-free language model GenBERT by 8% in exact match accuracy when trained under comparable weak supervised settings. This showcases the effectiveness and generalizability of modular networks that can handle explicit discrete reasoning over noisy programs in an end-to-end manner.",

In this paper, we present a novel Neuro-Symbolic Architecture (NSA) that combines the power of neural networks and symbolic regression to accurately predict spin magnitudes of black hole and neutron star mergers. Our approach utilizes GW waveform data obtained from numerical relativity simulations in the SXS Waveform catalog. By combining these two approaches, we leverage the strengths of both paradigms, enabling a comprehensive and accurate prediction of spin magnitudes. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves an impressive root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.05 and mean-squared-error (MSE) of 0.03 for the NSA model and an RMSE of 0.12 for the symbolic regression model alone. We train this model to handle higher-order multipole waveforms, with a specific focus on eccentric candidates, which are known to exhibit unique characteristics. Our results provide a robust and interpretable framework for predicting spin magnitudes in mergers. This has implications for understanding the astrophysical properties of black holes and deciphering the physics underlying the GW signals.",

    "abstract": "Traffic flow prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, especially in the prevention of traffic congestion in urban areas. While significant efforts have been devoted to enhancing the accuracy of traffic prediction, the interpretability of traffic prediction also needs to be considered to enhance persuasiveness, particularly in the era of deep-learning-based traffic cognition. Although some studies have explored interpretable neural networks from the feature and result levels, model-level explanation, which explains the reasoning process of traffic prediction through transparent models, remains underexplored and requires more attention. In this paper, we propose a novel self-constructed deep fuzzy neural network, SCDFNN, for traffic flow prediction with model interpretability. By leveraging recent advances in neuro-symbolic computation for automatic rule learning, SCDFNN learns interpretable human traffic cognitive rules based on deep learning, incorporating two innovations: (1) a new fuzzy neural network hierarchical architecture constructed for spatial-temporal dependences in the traffic feature domain; (2) a modified Wang-Mendel method used to fuse regional differences in traffic data, resulting in adaptive fuzzy-rule weights without sacrificing interpretability. Comprehensive experiments on well-known traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach is comparable to state-of-the-art deep models, and the SCDFNN's unique hierarchical architecture allows for transparency.",

In this work, we study the biases of LLMs in relation to those known in children when solving arithmetic word problems. Surveying the learning science literature, we posit that the problem-solving process can be split into three distinct steps: text comprehension, solution planning and solution execution. We construct tests for each one in order to understand whether current LLMs display the same cognitive biases as children in these steps. We generate a novel set of word problems for each of these tests, using a neuro-symbolic approach that enables fine-grained control over the problem features. We find evidence that LLMs, with and without instruction-tuning, exhibit human-like biases in both the text-comprehension and the solution-planning steps of the solving process, but not in the final step, in which the arithmetic expressions are executed to obtain the answer.",

It is assumed that three materials are mixed with fixed volume fractions and that the conductivity of one of the materials is infinite. The bound expands the Hashin-Shtrikman and Translation bounds to multiphase structures, it is derived using the technique of \\em localized polyconvexity that is a combination of Translation method and additional inequalities on the fields in the materials; similar technique was used by Nesi (1995) and Cherkaev (2009) for isotropic multiphase composites. This paper expands the bounds to the anisotropic composites. The lower bound of conductivity (G-closure) is a piece-wise analytic function of eigenvalues of K\\_{*}{,} that depends only on conductivities of components and their volume fractions. Also, we find optimal microstructures that realize the bounds, developing the technique suggested earlier by Albin Cherkaev and Nesi (2007) and Cherkaev (2009). The optimal microstructures are laminates of some rank for all regions. The found structures match the bounds in all but one region of parameters; we discuss the reason for the gap and numerically estimate it.",

In this paper we present a new mechanism for logical theory acquisition which takes a set of observed facts and learns to extract from them a set of logical rules and a small set of core facts which together entail the observations. Our approach is neuro-symbolic in the sense that the rule pred- icates and core facts are given dense vector representations. The rules are applied to the core facts using a soft unification procedure to infer additional facts. After k steps of forward inference, the consequences are compared to the initial observations and the rules and core facts are then encouraged towards representations that more faithfully generate the observations through inference. Our approach is based on a novel neural forward-chaining differentiable rule induction network. The rules are interpretable and learned compositionally from their predicates, which may be invented. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a variety of ILP rule induction and domain theory learning datasets.",

    "abstract": "The AgNOR technique, was applied to oral tissue sections of 185 oral cancer, 42 oral leukoplakia, 37 oral submucous fibrosis and 10 normal subjects to investigate whether any correlation held good in these different tissues. Compared to the AgNOR counts in normal oral epithelium, there was a gradation in increase in the mean AgNOR counts from oral leukoplakia to oral submucous fibrosis to oral carcinoma (P<0.01). This suggests that AgNOR count parallels with the degree of neoplastic transformation of oral epithelium. Three oral submucous fibrosis patients who showed very high AgNOR counts as that of oral cancer patients, later developed oral carcinoma. Among the oral cancer tissues, the moderately and poorly differentiated subtypes showed higher AgNOR counts and scattered distribution pattern than the well differentiated subtype which showed a clustered distribution pattern. These results suggest that AgNOR technique can be utilised as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator in premalignant and malignant oral tissues.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents for cyber applications take advantage of modern defense techniques by adopting intelligent agents with conventional and learning-enabled components. These intelligent agents are trained via reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, and can learn, adapt to, reason about and deploy security rules to defend networked computer systems while maintaining critical operational workflows. However, the knowledge available during training about the state of the operational network and its environment may be limited. The agents should be trustworthy so that they can reliably detect situations they cannot handle, and hand them over to cyber experts. In this work, we develop an out-of-distribution (OOD) Monitoring algorithm that uses a Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) to detect anomalous or OOD situations of RL-based agents with discrete states and discrete actions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we integrate the OOD monitoring algorithm with a neurosymbolic autonomous cyber agent that uses behavior trees with learning-enabled components. We evaluate the proposed approach in a simulated cyber environment under different adversarial strategies. Experimental results over a large number of episodes illustrate the overall efficiency of our proposed approach.",

In this paper, we propose Neurosymbolic Software Engineering, in short NSE, as a promising paradigm combining neural learning with symbolic (rule-based) reasoning, while strategically introducing a controlled source of chaos to simulate the complex dynamics of real-world software systems.

    "year": "2021",
    "author": "António, Branco",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The interpretation of anaphors depends on their antecedents as the semantic value that an anaphor eventually conveys is co-specified by the value of its antecedent. Interestingly, when occurring in a given syntactic position, different anaphors may have different sets of admissible antecedents. Such differences are the basis for the categorization of anaphoric expressions according to their anaphoric capacity, being important to determine what are the sets of admissible antecedents and how to represent and process this anaphoric capacity for each type of anaphor. From an empirical perspective, these constraints stem from what appears as quite cogent generalisations and exhibit a universal character, given their cross linguistic validity. From a conceptual point of view, in turn, the relations among binding constraints involve non-trivial cross symmetry, which lends them a modular nature and provides further strength to the plausibility of their universal character. This kind of anaphoric binding constraints appears thus as a most significant subset of natural language knowledge, usually referred to as binding theory. This paper provides an integrated overview of these constraints holding on the pairing of nominal anaphors with their admissible antecedents that are based on grammatical relations and structure. Along with the increasing interest on neuro-symbolic approaches to natural language, this paper seeks to contribute to revive the interest on this most intriguing research topic.",

    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is a growing field of research aiming to combine neural network learning capabilities with the reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. Informed multi-label classification is a sub-field of neurosymbolic AI which studies how to leverage prior knowledge to improve neural classification systems. Recently, a family of neurosymbolic techniques for informed classification based on probabilistic reasoning has gained significant traction. Unfortunately, depending on the language used to represent prior knowledge, solving certain probabilistic reasoning problems can become prohibitively hard when the number of classes increases. Therefore, the asymptotic complexity of probabilistic reasoning is of cardinal importance to assess the scalability of such techniques. In this paper, we develop a unified formalism for four probabilistic reasoning problems. Then, we compile several known and new tractability results into a single complexity map of probabilistic reasoning. We build on top of this complexity map to characterize the domains of scalability of several techniques. We hope this work will help neurosymbolic AI practitioners navigate the scalability landscape of probabilistic neurosymbolic techniques.",

    "abstract": "The last decades have seen a drastic improvement of Machine Learning (ML), mainly driven by Deep Learning (DL). However, despite the resounding successes of ML in many domains, the impossibility to provide guarantees of conformity and the fragility of ML systems (faced with distribution shifts, adversarial attacks, etc.) have prevented the design of trustworthy AI systems. Several research paths have been investigated to mitigate this fragility and provide some guarantees regarding the behavior of ML systems, among which are neurosymbolic AI and conformal prediction. Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence is a growing field of research aiming to combine neural network learning capabilities with the reasoning abilities of symbolic systems. One of the objective of this hybridization can be to provide theoritical guarantees that the output of the system will comply with some prior knowledge. Conformal prediction is a set of techniques that enable to take into account the uncertainty of ML systems by transforming the unique prediction into a set of predictions, called a confidence set. Interestingly, this comes with statistical guarantees regarding the presence of the true label inside the confidence set. Both approaches are distribution-free and model-agnostic. In this paper, we see how these two approaches can complement one another. We introduce several neurosymbolic conformal prediction techniques and explore their different characteristics (size of confidence sets, computational complexity, etc.).",

In spite of the recent impact of AI, several works have identified the need for principled knowledge representation and reasoning mechanisms integrated with deep learning-based systems to provide sound and explainable models for such systems.

Neural-symbolic computing has been an active topic of research for many years, reconciling the advantages of robust learning in neural networks and reasoning and interpretability of symbolic representation. In this paper, we survey recent accomplishments of neural-symbolic computing as a principled methodology for integrated machine learning and reasoning. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach by outlining the main characteristics of the methodology: principled integration of neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning allowing for the construction of explainable AI systems.

We explore the construction of safer conversational systems for guiding patients in preparing for colonoscopies.

Our study suggests large language models (e.g., GPT-3.5 & GPT-4) are a viable alternative to crowd sourced paraphrasing, but conversational systems that rely upon language models' ability to do temporal reasoning struggle to provide accurate responses. A neural-symbolic system that performs temporal reasoning on an intermediate representation of user queries shows promising results compared to an end-to-end dialogue system, improving the number of correct responses while vastly reducing the number of incorrect or misleading ones.",

To break the barrier, this rather opinionated personal memo attempts to explain and rectify the conventions in Statistics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning from the viewpoint of outsiders. It provides a step-by-step protocol for designing a machine learning system that satisfies a minimum theoretical guarantee necessary for being taken seriously by the symbolic AI community, i.e., it discusses \"in what condition we can stop worrying and accept statistical machine learning.\" Unlike most textbooks which are written for students trying to specialize in Stat/ML/DL and willing to accept jargons, this memo is written for experienced symbolic researchers that hear a lot of buzz but are still uncertain and skeptical. Information on Stat/ML/DL is currently too scattered or too noisy to invest in. This memo prioritizes compactness, citations to old papers (many in early 20th century), and concepts that resonate well with symbolic paradigms in order to offer time savings. It prioritizes general mathematical modeling and does not discuss any specific function approximator, such as neural networks (NNs), SVMs, decision trees, etc. Finally, it is open to corrections.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "We present a novel method for collaborative robots (cobots) to learn manipulation tasks and perform them in a human-like manner. Our method falls under the learn-from-observation (LfO) paradigm, where robots learn to perform tasks by observing human actions, which facilitates quicker integration into industrial settings compared to programming from scratch. We introduce Visual IRL that uses the RGB-D keypoints in each frame of the observed human task performance directly as state features, which are input to inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). The inversely learned reward function, which maps keypoints to reward values, is transferred from the human to the cobot using a novel neuro-symbolic dynamics model, which maps human kinematics to the cobot arm. This model allows similar end-effector positioning while minimizing joint adjustments, aiming to preserve the natural dynamics of human motion in robotic manipulation. In contrast with previous techniques that focus on end-effector placement only, our method maps multiple joint angles of the human arm to the corresponding cobot joints. Moreover, it uses an inverse kinematics model to then minimally adjust the joint angles, for accurate end-effector positioning. We evaluate the performance of this approach on two different realistic manipulation tasks. The first task is produce processing, which involves picking, inspecting, and placing onions based on whether they are blemished. The second task is liquid pouring, where the robot picks up bottles, pours the contents into designated containers, and disposes of the empty bottles. Our results demonstrate advances in human-like robotic manipulation, leading to more human-robot compatibility in manufacturing applications.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Infection is the most common complication of stroke. AIM: To determine the risk factors and predictors of post-stroke infection (PSI), which developed within 7 days from the onset of acute ischemic stroke. SUBJECTS: The study included 60 ischemic stroke patients admitted in the Neurology Department of Zagazig University, Egypt, who were subdivided into: [Non Stroke Associated Infection group (nSAI); 30 patients having stroke without any criteria of infection within 7 days from the onset and Stroke Associated Infection group (SAI); 30 patients having stroke with respiratory tract infection (RTI) or urinary tract infection within 7 days], in addition to 30 healthy sex and age-matching subjects as control. METHODS: All the patients had a detailed history taking, thorough clinical general and neurological examination, laboratory tests (Urine analysis & urine culture, blood sugar, lipid profile and serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-10), a chest radiography to assess RTI and brain computed tomography (CT) to exclude the hemorrhagic stroke and to confirm the ischemic stroke. RESULTS: SAI patients were found to be significantly older with higher baseline blood glucose level. Also the number of patients with tube feeding, lower conscious level, more stroke severity and more large size infarcts were significantly higher in SAI patients. There was a significant elevation in the IL-10, a significant decrease in the TNF-α and a significant decrease in the TNF-α/ IL-10 ratio, in the SAI group. The baseline serum level of IL-10 ≥ 14.5 pg/ ml and size of infarct area > 3.5 cm3 were found to be the independent predictors of PSI. CONCLUSION: Patients with older age, tube feeding, lower conscious level, worse baseline stroke severity, large cerebral infarcts in CT scan, and increased IL-10 serum level were more susceptible to infection. The baseline serum level of IL-10 ≥ 14.5 pg/ ml and the size of infarct area > 3.5 cm3 were the independent predictors of PSI.",

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks have achieved great success in some of the complex tasks that humans can do with ease. These include image recognition/classification, natural language processing, game playing etc. However, modern Neural Networks fail or perform poorly when trained on tasks that can be solved easily using backtracking and traditional algorithms. Therefore, we use the architecture of the Neuro Logic Machine (NLM) and extend its functionality to solve a 9X9 game of Sudoku. To expand the application of NLMs, we generate a random grid of cells from a dataset of solved games and assign up to 10 new empty cells. The goal of the game is then to find a target value ranging from 1 to 9 and fill in the remaining empty cells while maintaining a valid configuration. In our study, we showcase an NLM which is capable of obtaining 100% accuracy for solving a Sudoku with empty cells ranging from 3 to 10. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that NLMs can also be used for solving complex problems and games like Sudoku. We also analyze the behaviour of NLMs with a backtracking algorithm by comparing the convergence time using a graph plot on the same problem. With this study we show that Neural Logic Machines can be trained on the tasks that traditional Deep Learning architectures fail using Reinforcement Learning. We also aim to propose the importance of symbolic learning in explaining the systematicity in the hybrid model of NLMs.",

    "abstract": "The quality of olive oils is sensorially tested by accurate and well established methods. It enables the classification of the pressed oils into the classes of extra virgin oil, virgin oil and lampant oil. Nonetheless, it would be convenient to have analytical methods for screening oils or supporting sensorial analysis using a reliable independent approach based on exploitation of mass spectrometric methodologies. A number of methods have been proposed to evaluate deficiencies of extra virgin olive oils resulting from inappropriate technological treatments, such as high or low temperature deodoration, and home cooking processes. The quality and nutraceutical value of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) can be related to the antioxidant property of its phenolic compounds. Olive oil is a source of at least 30 phenolic compounds, such as oleuropein, oleocanthal, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol, all acting as strong antioxidants, radical scavengers and NSAI-like drugs. We now report the efficacy of MRM tandem mass spectrometry, assisted by the isotope dilution assay, in the evaluation of the thermal stability of selected active principles of extra virgin olive oil.",

    "author": "Avcu, Enes and Gow, David",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Human cognitive and linguistic generativity depends on the ability to identify abstract relationships between perceptually dissimilar items. Marcus et al. (1999) found that human infants can rapidly discover and generalize patterns of syllable repetition (reduplication) that depend on the abstract property of identity, but simple recurrent neural networks (SRNs) could not. They interpreted these results as evidence that purely associative neural network models provide an inadequate framework for characterizing the fundamental generativity of human cognition. Here, we present a series of deep long short-term memory (LSTM) models that identify abstract syllable repetition patterns and words based on training with cochleagrams that represent auditory stimuli. We demonstrate that models trained to identify individual syllable trigram words and models trained to identify reduplication patterns discover representations that support classification of abstract repetition patterns. Simulations examined the effects of training categories (words vs. patterns) and pretraining to identify syllables, on the development of hidden node representations that support repetition pattern discrimination. Representational similarity analyses (RSA) comparing patterns of regional brain activity based on MRI-constrained MEG/EEG data to patterns of hidden node activation elicited by the same stimuli showed a significant correlation between brain activity localized in primarily posterior temporal regions and representations discovered by the models. These results suggest that associative mechanisms operating over discoverable representations that capture abstract stimulus properties account for a critical example of human cognitive generativity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have succeeded remarkably in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, yet their reasoning capabilities remain a fundamental challenge. While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, their ability to perform complex reasoning-spanning logical deduction, mathematical problem-solving, commonsense inference, and multi-step reasoning-often falls short of human expectations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of emerging techniques enhancing reasoning in LLMs. We categorize existing methods into key approaches, including prompting strategies (e.g., Chain-of-Thought reasoning, Self-Consistency, and Tree-of-Thought reasoning), architectural innovations (e.g., retrieval-augmented models, modular reasoning networks, and neuro-symbolic integration), and learning paradigms (e.g., fine-tuning with reasoning-specific datasets, reinforcement learning, and self-supervised reasoning objectives). Additionally, we explore evaluation frameworks used to assess reasoning in LLMs and highlight open challenges, such as hallucinations, robustness, and reasoning generalization across diverse tasks. By synthesizing recent advancements, this survey aims to provide insights into promising directions for future research and practical applications of reasoning-augmented LLMs.",

DESIGN: Network meta-analysis (NMA). METHODS: Randomized clinical trials of ETs for HR+/HER2- mBC were identified via a systematic literature review using MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and key conference proceedings. All trials met the following inclusion criteria: (1) included women with HR+/HER2- mBC; (2) previous treatment with ETs or chemotherapy as first-line therapy; (3) treatment with ET as monotherapy or in combination with targeted therapy; (4) progression-free survival (PFS) was reported; and (5) published in 2007 (when HER2 testing became standardized) or later. Regimens were compared using pairwise hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) of PFS obtained from a Bayesian NMA. Treatments with different approved dosages were pooled into the same arm; anastrozole and exemestane were pooled as aromatase inhibitors (AIs) due to clinical similarities. RESULTS: A total of 4 trials and 6 regimens (palbociclib + fulvestrant, everolimus + fulvestrant, everolimus + AI, fulvestrant + AI, fulvestrant and AI) were eligible for inclusion. Palbociclib + fulvestrant and everolimus + AI had 50% and 55% reduced hazard of progression or death vs. AI (95% CrI upper bound ≤1), respectively. Palbociclib + fulvestrant, everolimus + AI and everolimus + fulvestrant had 54%, 58% and 40% reduced hazard vs. fulvestrant (95% CrI upper bound ≤1), while palbociclib + fulvestrant and everolimus + AI had 52% and 55% reduced hazard vs. fulvestrant + AI (95% CrI upper bound ≤1), respectively. CONCLUSION: Postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC who had previously failed an NSAI and received palbociclib + fulvestrant, everolimus + AI or everolimus + fulvestrant had longer PFS compared to those who received fulvestrant or AI alone.",

Metadata provides a brief overview of the paper while the Full-body text contains key-insights that can be valuable to fellow researchers. To retrieve metadata and key-insights from scientific papers, knowledge acquisition is a central activity. It consists of gathering, analyzing and organizing knowledge embedded in scientific papers in such a way that it can be used and reused whenever needed. Given the wealth of scientific literature, manual knowledge acquisition is a cumbersome task. Thus, computer-assisted and (semi-)automatic strategies are generally adopted. Our purpose in this research was two fold: curate Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) with papers related to ontology learning and define an approach using ORKG as a computer-assisted tool to organize key-insights extracted from research papers. This approach was used to document the epidemiological surveillance systems design and implementation research problem and to prepare the related work of this paper. It is currently used to document food information engineering , Tabular data to Knowledge Graph Matching and Question Answering research problems and Neuro-symbolic AI domain.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a tentative and original survey of meeting points between Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) and Machine Learning (ML), two areas which have been developed quite separately in the last four decades. First, some common concerns are identified and discussed such as the types of representation used, the roles of knowledge and data, the lack or the excess of information, or the need for explanations and causal understanding. Then, the survey is organised in seven sections covering most of the territory where KRR and ML meet. We start with a section dealing with prototypical approaches from the literature on learning and reasoning: Inductive Logic Programming, Statistical Relational Learning, and Neurosymbolic AI, where ideas from rule -based reasoning are combined with ML. Then we focus on the use of various forms of background knowledge in learning, ranging from additional regularisation terms in loss functions, to the problem of aligning symbolic and vector space representations, or the use of knowledge graphs for learning. Then, the next section describes how KRR notions may benefit to learning tasks. For instance, constraints can be used as in declarative data mining for influencing the learned patterns; or semantic features are exploited in low -shot learning to compensate for the lack of data; or yet we can take advantage of analogies for learning purposes. Conversely, another section investigates how ML methods may serve KRR goals. For instance, one may learn special kinds of rules such as default rules, fuzzy rules or threshold rules, or special types of information such as constraints, or preferences. The section also covers formal concept",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The AI community is increasingly focused on merging logic with deep learning to create Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) paradigms and assist neural approaches with symbolic knowledge. A significant trend in the literature involves integrating axioms and facts in loss functions by grounding logical symbols with neural networks and operators with fuzzy semantics. Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) is one of the main representatives in this category, known for its simplicity, efficiency, and versatility. However, it has been previously shown that not all fuzzy operators perform equally when applied in a differentiable setting. Researchers have proposed several configurations of operators, trading off between effectiveness, numerical stability, and generalization to different formulas. This paper presents a configuration of fuzzy operators for grounding formulas end-to-end in the logarithm space. Our goal is to develop a configuration that is more effective than previous proposals, able to handle any formula, and numerically stable. To achieve this, we propose semantics that are best suited for the logarithm space and introduce novel simplifications and improvements that are crucial for optimization via gradient-descent. We use LTN as the framework for our experiments, but the conclusions of our work apply to any similar NeSy framework. Our findings, both formal and empirical, show that the proposed configuration outperforms the state-of-the-art and that each of our modifications is essential in achieving these results.",

    "author": "Bahler, D. and Stone, B.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Experimental programs have been underway for several years to determine the environmental effects of chemical compounds, mixtures, and the like. Among these programs is the National Toxicology Program (NTP) on rodent carcinogenicity. Because these experiments are costly and time-consuming, the rate at which test articles (i.e., chemicals) can be tested is limited. The ability to predict the outcome of the analysis at various points in the process would facilitate informed decisions about the allocation of testing resources. To assist human experts in organizing an empirical testing regime, and to try to shed light on mechanisms of toxicity, we constructed toxicity models using various machine learning and data mining methods, both existing and those of our own devising. These models took the form of decision trees, rule sets, neural networks, rules extracted from trained neural networks, and Bayesian classifiers. As a training set, we used recent results from rodent carcinogenicity bioassays conducted by the NTP on 226 test articles. We performed 10-way cross-validation on each of our models to approximate their expected error rates on unseen data. The data set consists of physical-chemical parameters of test articles, alerting chemical substructures, salmonella mutagenicity assay results, subchronic histopathology data, and information on route, strain, and sex/species for 744 individual experiments. These results contribute to the ongoing process of evaluating and interpreting the data collected from chemical toxicity studies.",

    "abstract": "In social science, formal and quantitative models, such as ones describing economic growth and collective action, are used to formulate mechanistic explanations, provide predictions, and uncover questions about observed phenomena. Here, we demonstrate the use of a machine learning system to aid the discovery of symbolic models that capture nonlinear and dynamical relationships in social science datasets. By extending neuro-symbolic methods to find compact functions and differential equations in noisy and longitudinal data, we show that our system can be used to discover interpretable models from real-world data in economics and sociology. Augmenting existing workflows with symbolic regression can help uncover novel relationships and explore counterfactual models during the scientific process. We propose that this AI-assisted framework can bridge parametric and non-parametric models commonly employed in social science research by systematically exploring the space of nonlinear models and enabling fine-grained control over expressivity and interpretability.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological conditions for people of different age group, race, gender and socio-economic status in various nations, affecting 50 million people around the world; 80% of them living in developing countries. In Sudan, literature has well documented epilepsy stigma and it related elements of labelling, negative typecasting, isolation, devaluing and discrimination that are significantly affecting patients living standards and social life. This study focuses on understanding the prevailing, different types of stigma among people living with epilepsy (PWE) in Sudan and to determine its frequency in connection with demographic factors and patients coping ability of PWE. METHODS: A health facility-based cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted on 270 people between the ages of 16-70years who are affected by epilepsy in an outpatient clinic. Standardized questionnaires were used to interview the patients with assistance gotten from their relative where necessary. The data is analyzed using SPSS version 20. The study was conducted in the outpatient clinic of The National Center for Neurological Sciences (NCNS), Ibrahim-Malik Teaching Hospital Sudan. RESULTS: The study realized that 16.6% of the patient had a positive self-stigma score, half of them having coaching stigma and 25% courtesy stigma. One third of people with epilepsy had poor coping score that was strongly determined by self- stigma and courtesy stigma score. CONCLUSION: Parents and relatives related sigma is a major problem facing people of epilepsy in Sudan; thus, raising such group awareness and education about the disease can markedly improve the quality of life of people with epilepsy in Sudan.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Recent research efforts aiming to bridge the Neural-Symbolic gap for RDFS reasoning proved empirically that deep learning techniques can be used to learn RDFS inference rules. However, one of their main deficiencies compared to rule-based reasoners is the lack of derivations for the inferred triples (i.e. explainability in AI terms). In this paper, we build on these approaches to provide not only the inferred graph but also explain how these triples were inferred. In the graph words approach, RDF graphs are represented as a sequence of graph words where inference can be achieved through neural machine translation. To achieve explainability in RDFS reasoning, we revisit this approach and introduce a new neural network model that gets the input graph-as a sequence of graph words- as well as the encoding of the inferred triple and outputs the derivation for the inferred triple. We evaluated our justification model on two datasets: a synthetic dataset- LUBM benchmark- and a real-world dataset -ScholarlyData about conferences- where the lowest validation accuracy approached 96%.",

    "abstract": "Background In vivo, tracheal gland serous cells highly express the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) gene. This gene is mutated in the lethal monogenic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). Clinical trials in which the human CFTR cDNA was delivered to the respiratory epithelia of CF patients have resulted in weak and transient gene expression. Methods and results As CF is characterized by mucus inspissation, airway infection, and severe inflammation, we tested the hypothesis that inflammation and especially two cytokines involved in the Th1/Th2 inflammatory response, interleukin 4 (IL-4) and TNF alpha, could inhibit gene transfer efficiency using a model of human CF tracheal gland cells (CF-KM4) and Lipofectamine reagent as a transfection reagent. The specific secretory defects of CF-KM4 cells were corrected by Lipofectamine-mediated human CFTR gene transfer. However, this was altered when cells were pre-treated with IL-4 and TNF alpha. inhibition of luciferase reporter gene expression by IL-4 and TNF alpha pre-treated CF-KM4 cells was measured by activity and real-time RT-PCR. Both cytokines induced similar and synergistic inhibition of transgene expression and activity. This cytokine-mediated inhibition could be prevented by anti-inflammatory agents such as glucocorticoids but not by non-steroidal (NSAI) agents. Conclusions This data suggests that an inflammatory context generated by IL-4 and TNF alpha can inhibit human CFTR gene transfer in CF tracheal gland cells and that glucocorticoids may have a protecting action.

    "abstract": "Process automation is a key subfield of business process management. Recent advances in AI research promise to yield a new type of intelligent process automation that can support high-variability, flexible, knowledge-intensive processes previously hard to enhance with process automation. However, primarily proposed, subsymbolic deep learning approaches fail to reliably consider the complex knowledge inherent to these processes and provide adequate explanations for their decisions. Neuro-symbolic reasoning approaches based on knowledge graphs promise to address these challenges by allowing to holistically encode complex domain knowledge and to perform explainable reasoning thereupon. In this vision paper, we investigate the potential of knowledge graphs for intelligent process automation. Using tangible examples, we show how they can be used to enable explainable, knowledge-aware process automation, integrating a wide range of process knowledge. We show that such knowledge-aware process automation can contribute to addressing two current challenges of the BPM community: the automation of knowledge-intensive processes and the design of AI-augmented business process management systems. Finally, we discuss avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "The unification of the first-order logic and probability has been seen as a long-standing concern in philosophy, AI and mathematics. In this talk, I will briefly review our recent results on revisiting that unification. Although there are plenty of approaches in communities such as statistical relational learning, automated planning, and neuro-symbolic AI that leverage and develop languages with logical and probabilistic aspects, they almost always restrict the representation as well as the semantic framework in various ways which do not fully explain how to combine first-order logic and probability theory in a general way. In many cases, this restriction is justified because it may be necessary to focus on practicality and efficiency. However, the search for a restriction-free mathematical theory remains ongoing. In this article, we discuss our recent results regarding the development of languages that support arbitrary quantification, possibly infinitely many random variables, both discrete and continuous distributions, as well as programming languages built on top of such features to include recursion and branching control.",

    "abstract": "To get one step closer to ``human-like '' intelligence, we need systems capable of seamlessly combining the neural learning power of symbolic feature extraction from raw data with sophisticated symbolic inference mechanisms for reasoning about ``high-level '' concepts. It is important to also incorporate existing prior knowledge about a given problem domain, especially since modern machine learning frameworks are typically data-hungry. Recently the field of neuro-symbolic AI has emerged as a promising paradigm for precisely such an integration. However, coming up with a single, clear, concise definition of this area is not an easy task. There are plenty of variations on this topic, and there is no ``one true way '' that the community can coalesce around. Recently, a workshop was organized at AAMAS-2023 (London, UK) to discuss how this definition should be broadened to also consider reasoning about agents. This article is a collection of ideas, opinions, and positions from computer scientists who were invited for a panel discussion at the workshop. This collection is not meant to be comprehensive but is rather intended to stimulate further conversation on the field of ``Neuro-Symbolic Multi-Agent Systems. ''",

    "abstract": "Hardware-aware Neural Architectural Search (NAS) is gaining momentum to enable the deployment of deep learning on edge devices with limited computing capabilities. Incorporating device-related objectives such as affordable floating point operations, latency, power, memory usage, etc. into the optimization process makes searching for the most efficient neural architecture more complicated, since both model accuracy and hardware cost should guide the search. The main concern with most state-of-the-art hardware-aware NAS strategies is that they propose for evaluation also trivially infeasible network models for the capabilities of the hardware platform at hand. Moreover, previously generated models are frequently not exploited to intelligently generate new ones, leading to prohibitive computational costs for practical relevance. This paper aims to boost the computational efficiency of hardware-aware NAS by means of a neuro-symbolic framework revolving around a Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming module to define and exploit a set of symbolic rules. This component learns and refines the probabilities associated with the rules, allowing the framework to adapt and improve over time, thus quickly narrowing down the search space toward the most promising neural architectures.",

To tackle this issue, researchers incorporate Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to improve the reasoning ability of LLMs. However, existing methods face two limitations: 1) they typically assume that all answers to the questions are contained in KGs, neglecting the incompleteness issue of KGs, and 2) they treat the KG as a static repository and overlook the implicit logical reasoning structures inherent in KGs. In this paper, we introduce SymAgent, an innovative neural-symbolic agent framework that achieves collaborative augmentation between KGs and LLMs. We conceptualize KGs as dynamic environments and transform complex reasoning tasks into a multi-step interactive process, enabling KGs to participate deeply in the reasoning process. SymAgent consists of two modules: Agent-Planner and Agent-Executor. The Agent-Planner leverages LLM's inductive reasoning capability to extract symbolic rules from KGs, guiding efficient question decomposition. The Agent-Executor autonomously invokes predefined action tools to integrate information from KGs and external documents, addressing the issues of KG incompleteness. Furthermore, we design a self-learning framework comprising online exploration and offline iterative policy updating phases, enabling the agent to automatically synthesize reasoning trajectories and improve performance. Experimental results demonstrate that SymAgent with weak LLM backbones (i.e., 7B series) yields better or comparable performance compared to various strong baselines. Further analysis reveals that our agent can identify missing triples, facilitating automatic KG updates.",

    "year": "2025",
    "author": "Ben, Goertzel",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces ActPC-Geom, an approach to accelerate Active Predictive Coding (ActPC) in neural networks by integrating information geometry, specifically using Wasserstein-metric-based methods for measure-dependent gradient flows. We propose replacing KL-divergence in ActPC's predictive error assessment with the Wasserstein metric, suggesting this may enhance network robustness. To make this computationally feasible, we present strategies including: (1) neural approximators for inverse measure-dependent Laplacians, (2) approximate kernel PCA embeddings for low-rank approximations feeding into these approximators, and (3) compositional hypervector embeddings derived from kPCA outputs, with algebra optimized for fuzzy FCA lattices learned through neural architectures analyzing network states. This results in an ActPC architecture capable of real-time online learning and integrating continuous (e.g., transformer-like or Hopfield-net-like) and discrete symbolic ActPC networks, including frameworks like OpenCog Hyperon or ActPC-Chem for algorithmic chemistry evolution. Shared probabilistic, concept-lattice, and hypervector models enable symbolic-subsymbolic integration. Key features include (1) compositional reasoning via hypervector embeddings in transformer-like architectures for tasks like commonsense reasoning, and (2) Hopfield-net dynamics enabling associative long-term memory and attractor-driven cognitive features. We outline how ActPC-Geom combines few-shot learning with online weight updates, enabling deliberative thinking and seamless symbolic-subsymbolic reasoning. Ideas from Galois connections are explored for efficient hybrid ActPC/ActPC-Chem processing. Finally, we propose a specialized HPC design optimized for real-time focused attention and deliberative reasoning tailored to ActPC-Geom's demands.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of deep neural network architectures into the space of mission-critical applications raises great risks given the lack of transparency behind model predictions and the paucity of reliable metrics to quantify model uncertainty. By combining certainty and competence scoring, derived from a recent post-hoc uncertainty quantification framework, and with the use of logic tensor networks (LTN), a form of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence, we examine and make improvements to the baseline xView2 neural network architecture developed for disaster damage assessment for aerial image data. This framework is able to identify gross incompetence on the part of the baseline model at damage assessment despite its superficially strong performance with unbalanced data, while also demonstrating the relative resilience of LTNs that incorporate the baseline model as a trainable feature. In particular, we find that the baseline model absent additional logical information collapses in accuracy to a uniform guess, with attendant collapses in F1 score, whereas the LTN improves across measures of accuracy, F1 score, and various measures of certainty, competence, and logical satisfaction, motivating further development of these tools in mission critical settings with pervasive structural uncertainties.",

    "year": "2011",
    "author": "Beresford, M. and Tumur, I. and Chakrabarti, J. and Barden, J. and Rao, N. and Makris, A.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Aims: The most effective sequence of tamoxifen and both steroidal (SAIs) and non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) has been extensively studied in the adjuvant setting. However, treatments for women who have failed initial aromatase inhibitor therapy in the metastatic setting have received relatively little attention. A systematic review was undertaken to assess the use of SAIs and NSAIs in metastatic breast cancer. Materials and methods: Medline. Embase and the Cochrane library were searched using free text and MeSH terms. Studies assessing the cross-resistance, efficacy and safety of SAIs and NSAIs for postmenopausal women with advanced metastatic breast cancer confirmed by histology/cytology were included. Patients had progressed/relapsed from previous adjuvant, first- or second-line aromatase inhibitor treatment and had undergone treatment with at least two regimens consisting of aminoglutethimide, anastrozole, letrozole and/or exemestane. Results: Nine studies reported results for patients treated with an SAI after treatment failure with an NSAI. For SAI after NSAI, clinical benefit was the most frequently reported outcome. The clinical benefit for exemestane (SAI) after any NSAI failure or before treatment ranged from 12% (complete response not recorded, partial response 2%, stable disease 10%) to 55% (complete response 6%, partial response 13%, stable disease 35%) Survival outcomes were infrequently reported; four studies reported disease progression. The time to progression ranged from 3.7 to 5.2 months. Only one study reported a median overall survival with exemestane at 15.2 months. Only one study reported information for an NSAI after SAI and an NSAI followed by another NSAI. Discussion: This review suggests that switching from an NSAI to an SAI is a reasonable option. This would be particularly important for patients who would probably respond to further endocrine manoeuvres; strongly oestrogen receptor-positive disease, non-visceral disease, a good prior response or a long duration of response. Further research to optimise the sequence of endocrine therapies in metastatic breast cancer is needed. (C) 2010 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

Neural-symbolic approaches to inductive logic programming have been recently proposed to combine the advantages of inductive logic programming, in terms of interpretability and generalization capability, with the characteristic capacity of deep learning to treat noisy and nonlogical data. This paper concisely surveys and briefly compares three promising neural-symbolic approaches to inductive logic programming that have been proposed in the last five years. The considered approaches use Datalog dialects to represent background knowledge, and they are capable of producing reusable logical rules from noisy and non-logical data.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Modelling musical structure is vital yet challenging for artificial intelligence systems that generate symbolic music compositions. This literature review dissects the evolution of techniques for incorporating coherent structure, from symbolic approaches to foundational and transformative deep learning methods that harness the power of computation and data across a wide variety of training paradigms. In the later stages, we review an emerging technique which we refer to as ``sub-task decomposition '' that involves decomposing music generation into separate high-level structural planning and content creation stages. Such systems incorporate some form of musical knowledge or neuro-symbolic methods by extracting melodic skeletons or structural templates to guide the generation. Progress is evident in capturing motifs and repetitions across all three eras reviewed, yet modelling the nuanced development of themes across extended compositions in the style of human composers remains difficult. We outline several key future directions to realize the synergistic benefits of combining approaches from all eras examined.",

These LMs can accomplish many tasks, e.g., daily work assistant, intelligent customer service, and intelligent factory scheduling. Their development has contributed to various industries in human society.AimsThe architectural flaws of LMs lead to several problems, including illusions and difficulty in locating errors, limiting their performance. Solving these problems properly can facilitate their further development.MethodsThis work first introduces the development of LMs and identifies their current problems, including data and energy consumption, catastrophic forgetting, reasoning ability, localization fault, and ethical problems. Then, potential solutions to these problems are provided, including increase data and computation capability, neural-symbolic synergy, and data orientation to human pattern.DiscussionThis work discusses developing vertical domain LMs on top of some base LMs. In addition, this work introduces three typical real-world applications of LMs, including autonomous driving, smart industrial productions, and intelligent medical assistance.ConclusionBy embracing the advantages of LMs and solving their fundamental problems, many industries are expected to achieve promising prospects in the future.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "India has produced several drafts of data policies. In this work, they are referred to [ 1] JBNSCR 2018, [ 2] DPDPR 2018, [ 3] NSAI 2018, [ 4] RAITF 2018, [ 5] PDPB 2019, [ 6] PRAI 2021, [ 7] JPCR 2021, [ 8] IDAUP 2022, [ 9] IDABNUP 2022. All of them consider Artificial Intelligence (AI) a social problem solver at the societal level, let alone an incentive for economic growth. However, these policy drafts warn of the social disruptions caused by algorithms and encourage the careful use of computational technologies in various social contexts. Hence, the emerging data society and its implications in India's social contexts demand immense social science attention, which needs to be improved in the policy drafts, primarily because they are creations of industry stakeholders, technocrats, bureaucrats, and experts from tech schools. In the larger social milieu of digital infrastructure emerging, the fundamental question is whether India's national philosophy envisioned in the Indian constitution is reflected in the policy papers. The paper enquires whether the national data policy upholds the core values dispersed through the philosophy of the Indian constitution, which, among other things, is not confined only to inclusion, diversity, rights, liberty, justice and equality. By focusing on constitutional values, the paper seeks to offer a broader and more critical understanding of India's approach to AI policy by bringing together analyses of a wide array of policy documents available in the public realm.",

    "year": "2014",
    "author": "Bines, J. and Dienstmann, R. and Obadia R., M. and Branco L. G., P. and Quintella D., C. and Castro T., M. and Camacho P., G. and Soares F., A. and Costa M. E., F.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Background: As novel treatments carry substantial price tags and are mostly cost-prohibitive in low- and middle-income countries, there is an urgent need to develop alternatives, such as off-patent drugs. Megestrol acetate (MA) has a longstanding history in the treatment of breast cancer, but recently it is being used less often due to the advent of newer agents. Patients and methods: This two-stage phase II trial evaluated the antitumor activity and toxicity of MA in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive advanced breast cancer who had experienced disease progression on a third-generation nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). Eligible patients had metastatic breast cancer treated with a NSAI with at least 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), or relapse after >= 1 year on adjuvant NSAI. Patients received MA at a single daily oral dose of 160 mg. Primary end point was clinical benefit rate (CBR). Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled. The CBR was 40% [ 95% confidence interval (CI) 25% to 55%], and the median duration of clinical benefit was 10.0 (95% CI 8.0-14.2) months. The median PFS was 3.9 (95% CI 3.0-4.8) months. The most common grade 3 adverse events were anemia (2%), dyspnea (2%), fatigue (2%), musculoskeletal pain (4%), deep vein thrombosis (10%), and weight gain (2%). Conclusions: This is the first study to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of MA in postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive disease progressing on a NSAI. MA has demonstrated activity and acceptable tolerability in this setting, and therefore remains a reasonable treatment option in a cost-sensitive environment. These results also provide the background for further evaluation of progestins in the treatment of breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Integration between constrained optimization and deep networks has garnered significant interest from both research and industrial laboratories. Optimization techniques can be employed to optimize the choice of network structure based not only on loss and accuracy but also on physical constraints. Additionally, constraints can be imposed during training to enhance the performance of networks in specific contexts. This study surveys the literature on the integration of constrained optimization with deep networks. Specifically, we examine the integration of hyper-parameter tuning with physical constraints, such as the number of FLOPS (FLoating point Operations Per Second), a measure of computational capacity, latency, and other factors. This study also considers the use of context-specific knowledge constraints to improve network performance. We discuss the integration of constraints in neural architecture search (NAS), considering the problem as both a multi-objective optimization (MOO) challenge and through the imposition of penalties in the loss function. Furthermore, we explore various approaches that integrate logic with deep neural networks (DNNs). In particular, we examine logic-neural integration through constrained optimization applied during the training of NNs and the use of semantic loss, which employs the probabilistic output of the networks to enforce constraints on the output.",

Synthetic procedures and structure determination with the assistance of X-ray crystallography are discussed. Semiempirical molecular orbital calculations are used to investigate the relative stability of the possible isomers and tautomers of the title compounds. A biological profile of the class, and of several of the more potent analogues, in several antiinflammatory models, including the adjuvant-induced arthritis and the collagen II models, is defined. Several members of the class are shown to possess extremely low ulcerogenic effects in spite of exhibiting cyclooxygenase inhibition. A preliminary bioavailability study of two of the lead structures is presented. The compounds 6-72 appear to constitute a class of drugs that shows interesting potential antiarthritic activity and also exhibits an activity profile different from that of the standard classical NSAI drugs, as determined by a comparison of the profile of this class of drug with that of several standard agents. Certain findings from toxicological studies have precluded the further development of compounds within this group, although related structural types are being investigated.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "As software grows in complexity to accommodate diverse features and platforms, software bloating has emerged as a significant challenge, adversely affecting performance and security. However, existing approaches inadequately address the dual objectives of debloating: maintaining functionality by preserving essential features and enhancing security by reducing security issues. Specifically, current software debloating techniques often rely on input-based analysis, using user inputs as proxies for the specifications of desired features. However, these approaches frequently overfit provided inputs, leading to functionality loss and potential security vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose LEADER, a program debloating framework enhanced by Large Language Models (LLMs), which leverages their semantic understanding, generative capabilities, and decision-making strengths. LEADER mainly consists of two modules: (1) a documentation-guided test augmentation module designed to preserve functionality, which leverages LLMs to comprehend program documentation and generates sufficient tests to cover the desired features comprehensively, and (2) a multi-advisor-aided program debloating module that employs a neuro-symbolic pipeline to ensure that the security of the software can be perceived during debloating. This module combines debloating and security advisors for analysis and employs an LLM as a decision-maker to eliminate undesired code securely. Extensive evaluations on widely used benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of LEADER. These results demonstrate that LEADER surpasses the state-of-the-art tool CovA in functionality and security. These results underscore the potential of LEADER to set a new standard in program debloating by effectively balancing functionality and security.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning in the real world is not divorced from situations. How to capture the present knowledge from surrounding situations and perform reasoning accordingly is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. This paper introduces a new benchmark that evaluates the situated reasoning ability via situation abstraction and logic-grounded question answering for real-world videos, called Situated Reasoning in Real-World Videos (STAR Benchmark). This benchmark is built upon the real-world videos associated with human actions or interactions, which are naturally dynamic, compositional, and logical. The dataset includes four types of questions, including interaction, sequence, prediction, and feasibility. We represent the situations in real-world videos by hyper-graphs connecting extracted atomic entities and relations (e.g., actions, persons, objects, and relationships). Besides visual perception, situated reasoning also requires structured situation comprehension and logical reasoning. Questions and answers are procedurally generated. The answering logic of each question is represented by a functional program based on a situation hyper-graph. We compare various existing video reasoning models and find that they all struggle on this challenging situated reasoning task. We further propose a diagnostic neuro-symbolic model that can disentangle visual perception, situation abstraction, language understanding, and functional reasoning to understand the challenges of this benchmark.",

On the one hand, the architecture contains a symbolic knowledge base to represent norms and on the other hand it contains a neural network to reason with norms. The interaction between the symbolic knowledge and the neural network is used to learn norms. We describe how to handle normative reasoning issues like contrary to duties, dilemmas and exceptions by using a priority-based ordering between the norms in a neural-symbolic architecture.",

To this purpose, we define a fragment of Input/Output (I/O) logic that can be embedded into a neural network. We extend d'Avila Garcez et al. Connectionist Inductive Learning and Logic Programming System (CILP) to translate an I/O logic theory into a Neural Network (NN) that can be trained further with examples: we call this new system Normative-CILP (N-CILP). We then present a new algorithm to handle priorities between rules in order to cope with normative issues like Contrary to Duty (CTD), Priorities, Exceptions and Permissions. We illustrate the applicability of the framework on a case study based on RoboCup rules: within this working example, we compare the learning capacity of a network built with N-CILP with a non symbolic neural network, we explore how the initial knowledge impacts on the overall performance, and we test the NN capacity of learning norms, generalizing new Contrary to Duty rules from examples.",

    "abstract": "Industrial use of Radiation Thermometers (RTs) is becoming increasingly common due to the perceived advantages and wide market availability. Blackbody Cavity Radiation Sources (BCRSs) are typically used for calibration of these instruments, and these cavities are oriented horizontally in most cases. For BCRSs based in thermal baths, this necessitates the use of custom-built baths with side openings. This paper presents a unique design of vertical bath-based BCRS that may be immersed in conventional calibration baths without modifications to the baths. The method, results, and analysis of an international comparison comparing this vertical BCRS, standard horizontal BCRSs, and a previous iteration of the vertical design of BCRS are also presented. The comparison was conducted through collaboration between the Laboratory of Metrology and Quality, Slovenia (LMK) and the National Standards Authority Ireland (NSAI), with the intention of evaluating the suitability of the vertical orientation for calibration work. Transfer pyrometers and Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometers (SPRTs) were used as comparison standards. The transfer pyrometers used have spectral sensitivity from 8 mu m to 14 mu m in this temperature range. It was found that the vertical orientation was comparable to within 0.25 degrees C throughout the range to standard horizontal cavities. It was concluded that a vertical configuration is an economical alternative for calibration of RTs within the range assessed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

    "author": "Bonnet, J. and Loiseau, A. M. and Orvoen, M. and Bessin, P.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "PAF-acether is a potent aggregating agent released by various cells involved in acute inflammatory process. In this paper, exogenous PAF-acether has been investigated for its ability to generate signs of inflammation (edema measured by plethysmometry) and hyperalgesia (Randall-Sellito test) by standard subplantar injection in the rat paw. From 0.005 microgram. PAF-acether induced significant edema of the paw, maximal 1 hour after injection; it was dose-dependent from 0.1 to 5 microgram. Significant dose-dependent hyperalgesia occurred from 1.25 microgram; it reached a plateau from 2 to 4 hours after injection. Both phenomena were long-lasting (greater than 6 h). PAF-acether was 1.5 to 10 times stronger than PGI2 and PGE2 in inducing edema, pain, and in increasing vascular permeability. We investigated the interaction of miscellaneous drugs with the edema and the hyperalgesia caused by 2.5 microgram of PAF-acether. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs exerted only moderate effects on the edema without affecting hyperalgesia. Edema was highly reduced by various agents: prednisolone, L-cysteine, anti-calcic drugs, theophylline, PGI2, salbutamol, clonidine. All of them, except clonidine, and in contrast to NSAI drugs, were more potent on PAF-acether edema than on kaolin edema; a possible link between these agents is their ability to increase cyclic AMP levels in the cells and consequently to reduce lysosomal enzyme release. PAF-acether itself, injected intra-peritoneally, inhibited PAF-acether edema without preventing pain, at doses inactive on arterial pressure and hematocrit, but inducing marked gastric mucosal damage. Among the drugs tested, including analgesics, only PGI2 and imidazole improved PAF-induced hyperalgesia, showing a dissociation between edema and hyperalgesia not only in their induction (doses of PAF required, time course of the phenomena), but in the drugs able to antagonize their development too.",

    "abstract": "Despite their linguistic competence, Large Language models (LLMs) often exhibit limitations in their ability to reason reliably and flexibly. To address this, we propose a neurosymbolic approach that prompts LLMs to extract and encode all relevant information from a problem statement as logical code statements, and then use a logic programming language (Prolog) to conduct the iterative computations of explicit deductive reasoning. Our approach significantly enhances the performance of LLMs on the standard mathematical reasoning benchmark, GSM8k, and the Navigate dataset from the BIG-bench dataset. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset, the Non-Linear Reasoning (NLR) dataset, consisting of 55 unique word problems that target the shortcomings of the next token prediction paradigm of LLMs and require complex non-linear reasoning but only basic arithmetic skills to solve. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of Prolog enables LLMs to achieve high performance on the NLR dataset, which even the most advanced language models (including GPT4) fail to solve using text only.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The effective integration of knowledge representation, reasoning, and learning in a robust computational model is one of the key challenges of computer science and artificial intelligence. In particular, temporal knowledge and models have been fundamental in describing the behavior of computational systems. However, knowledge acquisition of correct descriptions of a system's desired behavior is a complex task. In this paper, we present a novel neural-computation model capable of representing and learning temporal knowledge in recurrent networks. The model works in an integrated fashion. It enables the effective representation of temporal knowledge, the adaptation of temporal models given a set of desirable system properties, and effective learning from examples, which in turn can lead to temporal knowledge extraction from the corresponding trained networks. The model is sound from a theoretical standpoint, but it has also been tested on a case study in the area of model verification and adaptation. The results contained in this paper indicate that model verification and learning can be integrated within the neural computation paradigm, contributing to the development of predictive temporal knowledge-based systems and offering interpretable results that allow system researchers and engineers to improve their models and specifications. The model has been implemented and is available as part of a neural-symbolic computational toolkit.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a neuro-symbolic agent that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with temporal logic (TL) to achieve systematic zero-shot, i.e., never-seen-before, generalisation of formally specified instructions. In particular, we present a neuro-symbolic framework where a symbolic module transforms TL specifications into a form that helps the training of a DRL agent targeting generalisation, while a neural module learns systematically to solve the given tasks. We study the emergence of systematic learning in different settings and find that the architecture of the convolutional layers is key when generalising to new instructions. We also provide evidence that systematic learning can emerge with abstract operators such as negation when learning from a few training examples, which previous research have struggled with.",

    "abstract": "A leading theory for ovarian carcinogenesis proposes that inflammation associated with incessant ovulation is a driver of oncogenesis. Consistent with this theory, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert promising chemopreventive activity for ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, toxicity is associated with long-term use of NSAI Ds due to their cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitory activity. Previous studies suggest the antineoplastic activity of NSAIDs is COX independent, and rather may be exerted through phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition. PDEs represent a unique chemopreventive target for ovarian cancer given that ovulation is regulated by cyclic nucleotide signaling. Here we evaluate PDE10A as a novel therapeutic target for ovarian cancer. Analysis ofThe Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian tumors revealed PDE10A overexpression was associated with significantly worse overall survival for patients. PDE10A expression also positively correlated with the upregulation of oncogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways. Using small molecule inhibitors, Pf-2545920 and a novel NSAID-derived PDE10A inhibitor, MCI-030, we show that PDE10A inhibition leads to decreased ovarian cancer cell growth and induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We demonstrate these pro-apoptotic properties occur through PKA and PKG signaling by using specific inhibitors to block their activity. PDE10A genetic knockout in ovarian cancer cells through CRISP/Cas9 editing lead to decreased cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and in vivo tumor growth. We also demonstrate that PDE10A inhibition leads to decreased Wnt-induced beta-catenin nuclear translocation, as well as decreased EGF-mediated activation of RAS/MAPK and AKT pathways in ovarian cancer cells. These findings implicate PDE10A as novel target for ovarian cancer chemoprevention and treatment.",

    "abstract": "From the report of Hirschberg, only 3 years after aspirin synthesis, there have been numerous works dedicated to showing the different types of adverse reactions found following aspirin administration. However, there are few publications on the process of urticaria and/or acute angioedema induced by ASA and few reported cases were found in children. Thus, we present 6 atopic children with urticaria and/or angioedema related with ASA. A carefully detailed history, oral provocation with ASA, oral provocation with other NSAI and HBDT with ASA were done to all of them. The oral provocation with ASA was positive in 5 of the 6 cases. The provocations with the rest of the NSAI and tartrazine and sodium benzoate were negative in all of the patients. The HBDT was positive in 5 of the cases. In conclusion, we insist that aspirin intolerance is not infrequent in infancy and it is not rare to see urticaria and or angioedema, in spite of the fact that asthmatics, atopics or non atopics, usually present as bronchospasm. We also believe that the HBDT can be a method of diagnosis used in these cases.",

Then some methodologies combining reasoning and learning are reviewed (such as inductive logic programming, neuro-symbolic reasoning, formal concept analysis, rule-based representations and ML, uncertainty in ML, or case-based reasoning and analogical reasoning), before discussing examples of synergies between KRR and ML (including topics such as belief functions on regression, EM algorithm versus revision, the semantic description of vector representations, the combination of deep learning with high level inference, knowledge graph completion, declarative frameworks for data mining, or preferences and recommendation). This paper is the first step of a work in progress aiming at a better mutual understanding of research in KRR and ML, and how they could cooperate.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "A robot that learns from demonstrations should not just imitate what it sees - it should understand the high-level concepts that are being demonstrated and generalize them to new tasks. Bilevel planning is a hierarchical model-based approach where predicates (relational state abstractions) can be leveraged to achieve compositional generalization. However, previous bilevel planning approaches depend on predicates that are either hand-engineered or restricted to very simple forms, limiting their scalability to sophisticated, high-dimensional state spaces. To address this limitation, we present IVNTR, the first bilevel planning approach capable of learning neural predicates directly from demonstrations. Our key innovation is a neuro-symbolic bilevel learning framework that mirrors the structure of bilevel planning. In IVNTR, symbolic learning of the predicate effects and neural learning of the predicate functions alternate, with each providing guidance for the other. We evaluate IVNTR in six diverse robot planning domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in abstracting various continuous and high-dimensional states. While most existing approaches struggle to generalize (with <35% success rate), our IVNTR achieves an average of 77% success rate on unseen tasks. Additionally, we showcase IVNTR on a mobile manipulator, where it learns to perform real-world mobile manipulation tasks and generalizes to unseen test scenarios that feature new objects, new states, and longer task horizons. Our findings underscore the promise of learning and planning with abstractions as a path towards high-level generalization.",

    "abstract": "We propose Hier-SLAM++, a comprehensive Neuro-Symbolic semantic 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method with both RGB-D and monocular input featuring an advanced hierarchical categorical representation, which enables accurate pose estimation as well as global 3D semantic mapping. The parameter usage in semantic SLAM systems increases significantly with the growing complexity of the environment, making scene understanding particularly challenging and costly. To address this problem, we introduce a novel and general hierarchical representation that encodes both semantic and geometric information in a compact form into 3D Gaussian Splatting, leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) as well as the 3D generative model. By utilizing the proposed hierarchical tree structure, semantic information is symbolically represented and learned in an end-to-end manner. We further introduce a novel semantic loss designed to optimize hierarchical semantic information through both inter-level and cross-level optimization. Additionally, we propose an improved SLAM system to support both RGB-D and monocular inputs using a feed-forward model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first semantic monocular Gaussian Splatting SLAM system, significantly reducing sensor requirements for 3D semantic understanding and broadening the applicability of semantic Gaussian SLAM system. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating superior or on-par performance with state-of-the-art NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SLAM systems, while significantly reducing storage and training time requirements.",

    "year": "2025",
    "author": "Brandon, C. Colelough and Regli, William",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Background: The field of Artificial Intelligence has undergone cyclical periods of growth and decline, known as AI summers and winters. Currently, we are in the third AI summer, characterized by significant advancements and commercialization, particularly in the integration of Symbolic AI and Sub-Symbolic AI, leading to the emergence of Neuro-Symbolic AI. Methods: The review followed the PRISMA methodology, utilizing databases such as IEEE Explore, Google Scholar, arXiv, ACM, and SpringerLink. The inclusion criteria targeted peer-reviewed papers published between 2020 and 2024. Papers were screened for relevance to Neuro-Symbolic AI, with further inclusion based on the availability of associated codebases to ensure reproducibility. Results: From an initial pool of 1,428 papers, 167 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in detail. The majority of research efforts are concentrated in the areas of learning and inference (63%), logic and reasoning (35%), and knowledge representation (44%). Explainability and trustworthiness are less represented (28%), with Meta-Cognition being the least explored area (5%). The review identifies significant interdisciplinary opportunities, particularly in integrating explainability and trustworthiness with other research areas. Conclusion: Neuro-Symbolic AI research has seen rapid growth since 2020, with concentrated efforts in learning and inference. Significant gaps remain in explainability, trustworthiness, and Meta-Cognition. Addressing these gaps through interdisciplinary research will be crucial for advancing the field towards more intelligent, reliable, and context-aware AI systems.",

Due to its rapid growth and impact on several communities in the last two decades, there is a need to better understand the space of these SWeML Systems, their characteristics, and trends. Yet, surveys that adopt principled and unbiased approaches are missing. To fill this gap, in our recently published paper [ 1], we performed a systematic study and analyzed nearly 500 papers published in the last decade in this area, where we focused on evaluating architectural, and application-specific features. Our analysis identified a rapidly growing interest in SWeML Systems, with a high impact on several application domains and tasks. Catalysts to this growth are the deep learning and knowledge graph technologies. By leveraging the in-depth understanding of the area, we publish the classification SWeML Systems as an ontology. We bring a complementary view to the NeSy community by showing how the SW community is deploying neuro-symbolic systems.",

The combination of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and the iontophoresis of benzydamine and diclofenac in a counter-current field is a new method in the treatment of chronical pain of the head and neck region. Prior to a clinical study this method was tested in a preliminary examination in 15 healthy volunteers. Clinical and physical data were investigated from which a theoretical maximum value of the quantity of iontophorised non-steroidal antiphlogistics (NSAI) could be calculated. The actual achievable absorption is discussed. Based on these data it is concluded that a good effective tissue concentration of benzydamine and diclofenac can be achieved with iontophoresis by means of TENS.",

    "abstract": "Encoder-decoder architectures are prominent building blocks of state-of-the-art solutions for tasks across multiple fields where deep learning (DL) or foundation models play a key role. Although there is a growing community working on the provision of interpretation for DL models as well as considerable work in the neuro-symbolic community seeking to integrate symbolic representations and DL, many open questions remain around the need for better tools for visualization of the inner workings of DL architectures. In particular, encoder-decoder models offer an exciting opportunity for visualization and editing by humans of the knowledge implicitly represented in model weights. In this work, we explore ways to create an abstraction for segments of the network as a two-way graph-based representation. Changes to this graph structure should be reflected directly in the underlying tensor representations. Such two-way graph representation enables new neuro-symbolic systems by leveraging the pattern recognition capabilities of the encoder-decoder along with symbolic reasoning carried out on the graphs. The approach is expected to produce new ways of interacting with DL models but also to improve performance as a result of the combination of learning and reasoning capabilities.",

Traditional HAR approaches often use invasive sensors like cameras or wearables, raising privacy issues.

These networks, integrated with symbolic reasoning frameworks such as DeepProbLog, enhance the adaptability and interpretability of HAR systems. SNNs offer reduced power consumption, ideal for privacy-sensitive applications. Experimental results demonstrate SNN-based neurosymbolic models achieve high accuracy making them a promising alternative for HAR across various domains.",

However, the deep learning-based method mainly focused on the fitting of a classification task via historical URL observation shows a limitation of recall due to the characteristics of zero-day attack. In order to model the nature of a zero-day phishing attack in which URL addresses are generated and discarded immediately, an approach that utilizes the expert knowledge is promising. We introduce the integration method of deep learning and logic programmed domain knowledge to inject the real-world constraints. We design neural and logic classifiers and propose the joint learning method of each component based on the traditional neuro-symbolic integration. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets consisting of 222,541 URLs showed the highest recall among the latest deep learning methods, despite the hostile class-imbalanced condition. We demonstrate that the optimized weighting between neural and logic component has an effect of improving the recall over 3% compared to the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning architectures based on convolutional neural networks tend to rely on continuous, smooth features. While this characteristics provides significant robustness and proves useful in many real-world tasks, it is strikingly incompatible with the physical characteristic of the world, which, at the scale in which humans operate, comprises crisp objects, typically representing well-defined categories. This study proposes a class of neurosymbolic systems that learn by reconstructing the observed images in terms of visual primitives and are thus forced to form high-level, structural explanations of them. When applied to the task of diagnosing abnormalities in histological imaging, the method proved superior to a conventional deep learning architecture in terms of classification accuracy, while being more transparent.",

    "abstract": "The introduction in Robotics of models inspired by biological clocks may be useful in order to cope with a number of problems, like, for example, an efficient resources management in the sensorial pattern elaboration, the coordination of different and parallel behaviors and the ability, for a robotic system, to adapt its emergent behavior to different contexts providing an emergent action selection mechanism. In this paper we present a general purpose neural-net able to obtain adaptive periodical controllers, described by means of the NSBL. NSBL is a Neuro-Symbolic Behavior modeling Language that allows one to express propositional logical inference and to translate them into the logically equivalent neural network. Such general periodic clocks are peculiar to each behavior, and their periods are influenced by the sensor input changing rate. In this way, the Robotic System is able to adapt its reaction time coherently to the changes occurring in the environment and to its internal state. To test our architecture we investigate the case of two conflicting behaviors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human ventriculum myosin (βmys) powers contraction sometimes in complex with myosin binding protein C (MYBPC3). The latter regulates βmys activity and impacts cardiac function. Single residue variants (SRVs) change protein sequence in βmys or MYBPC3 causing inheritable heart diseases by affecting the βmys/MYBPC3 complex. Muscle genetics encode instructions for contraction informing native protein construction, functional integration, and inheritable disease impairment. A digital model decodes these instructions and evolves by processing new information content from diverse data modalities using a human partner-driven virtuous cycle optimization. METHODS: A general neural-network contraction model characterizes SRV impacts on human health. It rationalizes phenotype and pathogenicity assignment given the SRVs characteristics and, in this sense, decodes βmys/MYBPC3 complex genetics and implicitly captures ventricular muscle functionality. When an SRV modified domain locates to an inter-protein contact in βmys/MYBPC3 it affects complex coordination. Domains involved, one in βmys and the other in MYBPC3, form coordinated domains (co-domains). Bilateral co-domains imply potential for their SRV modification probabilities to respond jointly to a common perturbation revealing location. Human genetic diversity from the serial founder effect is the common systemic perturbation coupling co-domains subsequently mapped by a method called 2-dimensional correlation genetics (2D-CG). RESULTS: Interpreting general neural-network contraction model output involves 2D-CG co-domain mapping providing structural insights with natural language expression. It aligns machine-learned intelligence from the neural network model with human provided structural insight from the 2D-CG map, and other data from the literature, to form a neural-symbolic hybrid model integrating genetic and protein-interaction data into a nascent digital twin. The process forms a template for combining new information content from diverse data modalities into an evolving digital model. This nascent digital twin interprets SRV implications for disease mechanism discovery.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Real world planning problems are often too complex to be effectively tackled by a single unaided human. To alleviate this, some recent work has focused on developing a collaborative planning system to assist humans in complex domains, with bridging the gap between the system's problem representation and the real world being a key consideration. Transferring the speed and correctness formal planners provide to real-world planning problems is greatly complicated by the dynamic and online nature of such tasks. Formal specifications of task and environment dynamics frequently lack constraints on some behaviors or goal conditions relevant to the way a human operator prefers a plan to be carried out. While adding constraints to the representation with the objective of increasing its realism risks slowing down the planner, we posit that the same benefits can be realized without sacrificing speed by modeling this problem as an online preference learning task. As part of a broader cooperative planning system, we present a feedback-driven plan critic. This method makes use of reinforcement learning with human feedback in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to directly optimize a plan with respect to natural-language user preferences despite the non-differentiability of traditional planners. Directly optimizing the plan bridges the gap between research into more efficient planners and research into planning with language models by utilizing the convenience of natural language to guide the output of formal planners. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our plan critic at adhering to user preferences on a disaster recovery task, and observe improved performance compared to an llm-only neurosymbolic approach.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This pooled analysis of MONALEESA trials evaluated the safety of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy (RIB + ET) with a focus on dose reductions in first-line patients. METHODS: In the dose reduction analysis, data were pooled from MONALEESA-2 (all patients), MONALEESA-3 (patients receiving treatment as first-line ET) and MONALEESA-7 (patients receiving combination therapy with an NSAI as initial ET). Efficacy was analysed by ribociclib relative dose intensity (DI). Safety was analysed in all patients in the trials (except those receiving tamoxifen in MONALEESA-7) and those with/without ≥1 ribociclib dose reduction. RESULTS: Of 818 women who received first-line RIB + ET, 41.8% required ≥1 dose reduction due to AEs (most commonly, neutropenia). Median RIB relative DI in patients without and with dose reductions was 99.3% and 65.6% in MONALEESA-2, 98.4% and 67.8% in MONALEESA-3 and 98·0% and 66·3% in MONALEESA-7. Median PFS was 24.8, 24.9 and 29.6 months for patients who received ≤71% (30th percentile), 72-96% (60th percentile) and 97-100% (90th percentile) RIB relative DI, respectively. No new safety signals emerged in the pooled safety analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides reassuring data showing that the clinical benefit of RIB is preserved when dose modifications are undertaken to manage AEs.

Increase in the use of standard NSAI for treating pain and inflammation was restricted by the fact that these drugs were proven to possibly cause gastrointestinal and renal toxicity. Meloxicam is a NSAI that has anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. This study aims to investigate the effects of meloxicam on stomach, kidney, and liver of rats under light microscopy level. Based on the light microscopic observations, mononuclear cell infiltration and pseudolobular formation was established in liver samples of animals in the experimental group. Metaplasia in surface and glandular epithelia and atrophy were observed in stomach samples. Glomerular stasis-related hypertrophy and focal interstitial nephritis were found in kidneys. It was concluded in this study that meloxicam might cause hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and gastric metaplasia in rats at a used dose and duration.",

Through a quantitative and qualitative analysis of results, we elucidate the profound impact of technological advancements on information processing, work culture, and social dynamics, highlighting the role of digital connectivity in exacerbating stressors. Economic pressures and social isolation further compound these challenges, contributing to a pervasive sense of unease and disconnection. Environmental stressors, including climate change, add another layer of complexity, fostering existential concerns about the future. Moreover, the persistent stigma surrounding mental health perpetuates a cycle of silence and suffering, hindering access to support and resources.

Now that new techniques are available for the resolution of racemic mixtures, there is an increasing pressure to only synthesise single enantiomers, and although guidelines on stereoisomers from the all regulatory agencies are awaited, there is already sufficient information to suggest that developmental studies on racemates will be greatly increased. There is often stereospecificity in pharmacology and toxicology, but this is frequently not the case for pharmacokinetics where enantiomeric differences may only play a relatively small contribution to overall drug activity, except for some exceptions (NSAI).

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Everolimus (EVE; an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR]) enhances treatment options for postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-negative (HER2(-)) advanced breast cancer (ABC) who progress on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). This is especially true for patients with visceral disease, which is associated with poor prognosis. The BOLERO-2 (Breast cancer trial of OraLEveROlimus-2) trial showed that combination treatment with EVE and exemestane (EXE) versus placebo (PBO)+EXE prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) by both investigator (7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively) and independent (11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively) central assessment in postmenopausal women with HR(+), HER2(-) ABC recurring/progressing during/after NSAI therapy. The BOLERO-2 trial included a substantial proportion of patients with visceral metastases (56%). METHODS: Prespecified exploratory subgroup analysis conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EVE+EXE versus PBO+EXE in a prospectively defined subgroup of patients with visceral metastases. FINDINGS: At a median follow-up of 18 months, EVE+EXE significantly prolonged median PFS compared with PBO+EXE both in patients with visceral metastases (N=406; 6.8 versus 2.8 months) and in those without visceral metastases (N=318; 9.9 versus 4.2 months). Improvements in PFS with EVE+EXE versus PBO+EXE were also observed in patients with visceral metastases regardless of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS). Patients with visceral metastases and ECOG PS 0 had a median PFS of 6.8 months with EVE+EXE versus 2.8 months with PBO+EXE. Among patients with visceral metastases and ECOG PS ≥1, EVE+EXE treatment more than tripled median PFS compared with PBO+EXE (6.8 versus 1.5 months). INTERPRETATION: Adding EVE to EXE markedly extended PFS by ≥4 months among patients with HR(+) HER2(-) ABC regardless of the presence of visceral metastases.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Everolimus (EVE)+exemestane (EXE; n = 485) more than doubled median progression-free survival versus placebo (PBO) + EXE (n = 239), with a manageable safety profile and no deterioration in health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) in patients with hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) advanced breast cancer (ABC) who recurred or progressed on/after nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy. To further evaluate EVE + EXE impact on disease burden, we conducted additional post-hoc analyses of patient-reported HRQOL. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: HRQOL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 questionnaires at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation because of disease progression, toxicity, or consent withdrawal. Endpoints included the QLQ-C30 Global Health Status (QL2) scale, the QLQ-BR23 breast symptom (BRBS), and arm symptom (BRAS) scales. Between-group differences in change from baseline were assessed using linear mixed models with selected covariates. Sensitivity analysis using pattern-mixture models determined the effect of study discontinuation on/before week 24. Treatment arms were compared using differences of least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) at each timepoint and overall. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00863655. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Progression-free survival, survival, response rate, safety, and HRQOL. RESULTS: Linear mixed models (primary model) demonstrated no statistically significant overall difference between EVE + EXE and PBO + EXE for QL2 (LSM difference = -1.91; 95% CI = -4.61, 0.78), BRBS (LSM difference = -0.18; 95% CI = -1.98, 1.62), or BRAS (LSM difference = -0.42; 95% CI = -2.94, 2.10). Based on pattern-mixture models, patients who dropped out early had worse QL2 decline on both treatments. In the expanded pattern-mixture model, EVE + EXE-treated patients who did not drop out early had stable BRBS and BRAS relative to PBO + EXE. KEY LIMITATIONS: HRQOL data were not collected after disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses confirm that EVE + EXE provides clinical benefit without adversely impacting HRQOL in patients with HR(+) ABC who recurred/progressed on prior NSAIs versus endocrine therapy alone.",

ARLC features a novel and more broadly applicable training objective for abductive reasoning, resulting in better interpretability and higher accuracy when solving Raven's progressive matrices (RPM). ARLC allows both programming domain knowledge and learning the rules underlying a data distribution. We evaluate ARLC on the IRAVEN dataset, showcasing state-of-the-art accuracy across both indistribution and out-of-distribution (unseen attribute-rule pairs) tests. ARLC surpasses neuro-symbolic and connectionist baselines, including large language models, despite having orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We show ARLC's robustness to post-programming training by incrementally learning from examples on top of programmed knowledge, which only improves its performance and does not result in catastrophic forgetting of the programmed solution. We validate ARLC's seamless transfer learning from a 2x2 RPM constellation to unseen constellations. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/abductive- rule-learner-with-context- awareness.",

After revision, it was then possible to determine an AERC indice (Ascorbate Equivalent Reducing Capacity) and a CECC (Carnosine Equivalent Chelating Capacity) or EECC (EDTA Equivalent Chelating Capacity) indice according to the standard chosen, by analogy to the TEAC indice (Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) already used in many reported works to determine the free radical scavenging activity. Thus, the determination of these relative indices enables the comparison of antioxidative capacities obtained in various studies. The adaptation of these two tests to micro-scales and the calculation of AERC, EECC and CECC were performed on model peptides.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Aseptic meningitis is a process that is characterised by an inflammatory reaction of the meninges that is not due to any infectious agent. Its aetiology is varied and is most frequently caused by rheumatologic and/or autoimmune processes, chemical or medication-induced meningitis, the most notable drugs involved being antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAI). CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 70-year-old male, with no relevant history, who was admitted to hospital five times over a period of 16 months because of acute meningitis with polymorphonuclear pleocytosis, high protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid and normal glucose in cerebrospinal fluid. No evidence of an infectious causation, chemical meningitis, carcinomatosis or autoimmune disease was found and the patient was diagnosed with recurrent aseptic meningitis. It was found that the patient had taken ibuprofen or ketorolac on several occasions, a few hours before the appearance of symptoms. These episodes were quickly resolved after withdrawal of this medication. CONCLUSIONS: A number of NSAI have been reported as inducers of aseptic meningitis, one of the most notable being ibuprofen. We report the case of a patient who, as a consequence of taking ibuprofen and ketorolac, presented episodes of recurrent aseptic meningitis. To our knowledge this side effect of ketorolac has not been reported before. Its clinical features are impossible to differentiate from those of infectious meningitis. Diagnosis is reached by exclusion and a careful pharmacological study, including over-the-counter drugs like some of the NSAI, must be performed in patients with this condition, since it is a problem that can easily be solved by withdrawing the drug that causes it.",

As these technologies become more interconnected and interdependent, Industry 4.0 systems become more complex, which brings the difficulty of identifying and stopping anomalies that may cause disturbances in the manufacturing process. This paper aims to propose a diffusion-based model for real-time anomaly prediction in Industry 4.0 processes. Using a neuro-symbolic approach, we integrate industrial ontologies in the model, thereby adding formal knowledge on smart manufacturing. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective way of distilling diffusion models through Random Fourier Features for deployment on an embedded system for direct integration into the manufacturing process. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has never been explored before.",

    "abstract": "In the field of Sequential Decision Making (SDM), two paradigms have historically vied for supremacy: Automated Planning (AP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the spirit of reconciliation, this article reviews AP, RL and hybrid methods (e.g., novel learn to plan techniques) for solving Sequential Decision Processes (SDPs), focusing on their knowledge representation: symbolic, subsymbolic, or a combination. Additionally, it also covers methods for learning the SDP structure. Finally, we compare the advantages and drawbacks of the existing methods and conclude that neurosymbolic AI poses a promising approach for SDM, since it combines AP and RL with a hybrid knowledge representation.",

    "author": "Carlos, Leandro",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The development of machine learning in particular and artificial intelligent in general has been strongly conditioned by the lack of an appropriate interface layer between deduction, abduction and induction. In this work we extend traditional algebraic specification methods in this direction. Here we assume that such interface for AI emerges from an adequate Neural-Symbolic integration. This integration is made for universe of discourse described on a Topos governed by a many-valued Ł ukasiewicz logic. Sentences are integrated in a symbolic knowledge base describing the problem domain, codified using a graphic-based language, wherein every logic connective is defined by a neuron in an artificial network. This allows the integration of first-order formulas into a network architecture as background knowledge, and simplifies symbolic rule extraction from trained networks. For the train of such neural networks we changed the Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, restricting the knowledge dissemination in the network structure using soft crystallization. This procedure reduces neural network plasticity without drastically damaging the learning performance, allowing the emergence of symbolic patterns. This makes the descriptive power of produced neural networks similar to the descriptive power of Ł ukasiewicz logic language, reducing the information lost on translation between symbolic and connectionist structures. We tested this method on the extraction of knowledge from specified structures. For it, we present the notion of fuzzy state automata, and we use automata behaviour to infer its structure. We use this type of automata on the generation of models for relations specified as symbolic background knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Computation is classically studied in terms of automata, formal languages and algorithms; yet, the relation between neural dynamics and symbolic representations and operations is still unclear in traditional eliminative connectionism. Therefore, we suggest a unique perspective on this central issue, to which we would like to refer as transparent connectionism, by proposing accounts of how symbolic computation can be implemented in neural substrates. In this study we first introduce a new model of dynamics on a symbolic space, the versatile shift, showing that it supports the real-time simulation of a range of automata. We then show that the Gödelization of versatile shifts defines nonlinear dynamical automata, dynamical systems evolving on a vectorial space. Finally, we present a mapping between nonlinear dynamical automata and recurrent artificial neural networks. The mapping defines an architecture characterized by its granular modularity, where data, symbolic operations and their control are not only distinguishable in activation space, but also spatially localizable in the network itself, while maintaining a distributed encoding of symbolic representations. The resulting networks simulate automata in real-time and are programmed directly, in the absence of network training. To discuss the unique characteristics of the architecture and their consequences, we present two examples: (i) the design of a Central Pattern Generator from a finite-state locomotive controller, and (ii) the creation of a network simulating a system of interactive automata that supports the parsing of garden-path sentences as investigated in psycholinguistics experiments.",

    "abstract": "Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) is a Neuro-Symbolic framework that effectively incorporates deep learning and logical reasoning. In particular, LTN allows defining a logical knowledge base and using it as the objective of a neural model. This makes learning by logical reasoning possible as the parameters of the model are optimized by minimizing a loss function composed of a set of logical formulas expressing facts about the learning task. The framework learns via gradient-descent optimization. Fuzzy logic, a relaxation of classical logic permitting continuous truth values in the interval [0,1], makes this learning possible. Specifically, the training of an LTN consists of three steps. Firstly, (1) the training data is used to ground the formulas. Then, (2) the formulas are evaluated, and the loss function is computed. Lastly, (3) the gradients are back-propagated through the logical computational graph, and the weights of the neural model are changed so the knowledge base is maximally satisfied. LTNtorch is the fully documented and tested PyTorch implementation of Logic Tensor Networks. This paper presents the formalization of LTN and how LTNtorch implements it. Moreover, it provides a basic binary classification example.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning have led to a surge in adoption of neural networks for various tasks, but lack of interpretability remains an issue for many others in which an understanding of the features influencing the prediction is necessary to ensure fairness, safety, and legal compliance. In this paper we consider one class of such tasks, tabular dataset classification, and propose a novel neuro-symbolic architecture, Neural Reasoning Networks (NRN), that is scalable and generates logically sound textual explanations for its predictions. NRNs are connected layers of logical neurons which implement a form of real valued logic. A training algorithm (R-NRN) learns the weights of the network as usual using gradient descent optimization with backprop, but also learns the network structure itself using a bandit-based optimization. Both are implemented in an extension to PyTorch (https://github.com/IBM/torchlogic) that takes full advantage of GPU scaling and batched training. Evaluation on a diverse set of 22 open-source datasets for tabular classification demonstrates performance (measured by ROC AUC) which improves over multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and is statistically similar to other state-of-the-art approaches such as Random Forest, XGBoost and Gradient Boosted Trees, while offering 43% faster training and a more than 2 orders of magnitude reduction in the number of parameters required, on average. Furthermore, R-NRN explanations are shorter than the compared approaches while producing more accurate feature importance scores.",

Polylactide microspheres loaded with 1-methyl-5-p-toluoylpyrrole-2-acetic acid (tolmetin) were prepared by the spray-drying method. Samples made of liposomes charged with free drug and suspensions of blank liposomes added to weighed amounts of tolmetin-loaded microspheres were analyzed by DSC. Calorimetric analyses were performed on samples previously incubated at temperatures below and above the polymer glass transition temperature (T-g). Free drug was found to interact with the phospholipidic bilayer by modifying its thermotropic behavior. The amount of drug released from the microparticulate to void liposomes was quantified by comparing the T-m shift caused by drug release from the polymeric system with that due to free drug. The results demonstrate the extent to which the release process is affected by temperature throughout the polymeric structure. In conclusion, the calorimetric technique detects changes occurring directly on the adsorption sites and can thus be applied to study slow kinetics directly al the site of drug uptake.",

Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code. Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods. Guess & Sketch extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output. We test Guess & Sketch on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler. We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task.",

We then consider semantic parsing works from an evolutionary perspective, with specific analyses on neuro-symbolic methods, architecture, and supervision. We then analyze advancements in frameworks for semantic parsing for code generation. In closing, we present what we believe are some of the emerging open challenges in this domain.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The estimated prevalence of hemorrhoidal disease (HD) worldwide ranges from 2.9% to 27.9%. Conservative, medical, non-operative, and surgical therapy approaches are applied in HD treatment. Milligan-Morgan (MM) hemorrhoidectomy which is the most well-known and frequently applied surgical treatment method, and Laser hemorrhoidoplasty (LH) are among the accepted treatment methods in Grade 2-3 HD treatment where medical treatment is insufficient. PURPOSE: In this study, the early results of laser hemorrhoidoplasty and Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy techniques were compared. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized clinical trial. The study included ASA 1-3, total 85 patients aged 18-70 years old with symptomatic Grade 2 and Grade 3 hemorrhoidal disease whose symptoms persisted despite at least one month of medical treatment. Fifty-four patients were allocated to Group L, whereas 31 were allocated to Group M. Age, gender, weight, body mass index, preoperative symptoms, presence of additional disease, use of anticoagulant medication, and length of hospital stay of the patients included in the study were recorded. Rescue analgesic used was recorded. Postoperative VAS score and complications were recorded within 10 days. The total energy numbers applied to all packages were recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of minor perioperative hemorrhage was significantly lower in Group L compared to Group M (P = .035). The postoperative 3rd-hour VAS scores were statistically significantly lower in Group L compared to Group (P < .001). At the 3rd hour postoperatively, the need for rescue analgesia was statistically significantly higher in Group M compared to Group L. On the seventh postoperative day, Group M needed considerably more rescue analgesia compared to Group L (P < .001, P = 1.00, P = .035, respectively). The cut-off value of 571 J was calculated in Group L. CONCLUSION: We believe that it is not an advantageous method compared to MM hemorrhoidectomy, both in terms of patient comfort and cost-effectiveness, since postoperative pain, which is shown as the most important advantage of LH over conventional hemorrhoidectomy methods in the literature, can be relieved with simple NSA-I rescue analgesia in patients undergoing MM.

    "abstract": "Drugs may cause adverse effects even they are used correctly. Therefore, drugs need to be monitored during postmarketing period. An adverse drug reaction is an unwanted or harmful reaction experienced after the administration of a drug due to use of a drug or suspected relation to the use of drug or use of a drug in combination with other drugs under normal conditions. Adverse drug reactions can sometimes occur due to individual differences including genetic polymorphism and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors. Adverse effect reporting has been increasing. Drug-induced mental health problems, which occur somewhat commonly, include depression, psychosis, mania, and confusion. Sometimes psychotropic drugs or their combinations with other drugs can result in adverse reactions. It has been demonstrated that sexual side effects, especially decreased libido were the most frequent adverse effects during antidepressant treatment. Others included various dermatological, cardiovascular, hemotological, and neurological reactions. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) can cause bleeding and the risk may increase more in case of combination with non-steroidal antiinflammatory (NSAI) drugs. The combinations mostly with trycyclic antidepressants (TCA) and sometimes with SSRI may result in serotonin syndrome. A withdrawal syndrome can occur when Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) drugs and tricyclic antidepressants are stopped suddenly. Reports have revealed that diabetes, increase in serum leptin, insulin resistance, negative effects on lipid profile, angioedema, and cardiovascular disease risk incidences have been higher in patients treated with new generation antipsychotics. Healthcare professionals have an important role to play in preventing adverse reactions due to prescribed or over-the-counter medicines. Establishing unbiased organizations to monitor adverse drug effects of drugs and receive reports of adverse effect notices on a scheduled basis have been an important issue world- wide. In this regard, TUFAM (Turkish Center for Monitoring and Evaluating Adverse Drug Effects), a unit of Turkish Ministry of Health, was established and has been in operation since 1985 in the field of pharmacovigilance. On the adverse drug effects issue, we the healthcare professionals should report the noticed adverse effect incidences promptly to TUFAM. In addition we should share our experiences with global healthcare community by writing and submitting case reports and articles to scientific periodicals.",

While tracing its historical journey from conception to practical implementation, the paper positions GenAI not as the sole solution but as the inception of a new era shaping network design, deployment strategies, and synchronous optimization dynamics. We also scrutinize the role of causal AI and transparent frameworks, such as explainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI in fostering trust and seamlessly integrating domain knowledge. Looking ahead beyond GenAI, we envision a future AI landscape composed of semantic communications, collaborative GenAI and discriminative agents. We also examine the challenges related to scalability and complexity that must be overcome to achieve sustainable AI deployments.

Despite recent advances, language communication in embodied AI still faces many challenges. Human language not only needs to ground to agents' perception and action but also needs to facilitate collaboration between humans and agents. To address these challenges, I will introduce several efforts in my lab that study pragmatic communication with embodied agents. I will talk about how language use is shaped by shared experience and knowledge (i.e., common ground) and how collaborative effort is important to mediate perceptual differences and handle exceptions. I will discuss task learning by following language instructions and highlight the need for neurosymbolic representations for situation awareness and transparency. I will further present explicit modeling of partners' goals, beliefs, and abilities (i.e., theory of mind) and discuss its role in language communication for situated collaborative tasks.",

    "year": "1998",
    "author": "Chan, S. K. and Franklin, J.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Natural language understanding involves the simultaneous consideration of a large number of different sources of information. Traditional methods employed in language analysis have focused on developing powerful formalisms to represent syntactic or semantic structures along with rules for transforming language into these formalisms. However, they make use of only small subsets of knowledge. This article will describe how to use the whole range of information through a neurosymbolic architecture which is a hybridization of a symbolic network and subsymbol vectors generated from a connectionist network. Besides initializing the symbolic network with prior knowledge, the subsymbol vectors are used to enhance the system's capability in disambiguation and provide flexibility in sentence understanding. The model captures a diversity of information including word associations, syntactic restrictions, case-role expectations, semantic rules and context. It attains highly interactive processing by representing knowledge in an associative network on which actual semantic inferences are performed. An integrated use of previously analyzed sentences in understanding is another important feature of our model. The model dynamically selects one hypothesis among multiple hypotheses. This notion is supported by three simulations which show the degree of disambiguation relies both on the amount of linguistic rules and the semantic-associative information available to support the inference processes in natural language understanding. Unlike many similar systems, our hybrid system is more sophisticated in tackling language disambiguation problems by using linguistic clues from disparate sources as well as modeling context effects into the sentence analysis. It is potentially more powerful than any systems relying on one processing paradigm.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Five ewes were injected with two doses of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAI), lysine acetyl salicylate, at birth of their first lamb and one hour later, and five others were injected once only, at birth of their first lamb. A control group of six animals was constituted. The times needed for fetal expulsion and placental release were recorded. The peripheral plasma PgF2alpha (as PGFM) levels were measured prepartum during the seven last days of gestation, at parturition, then 1 h, 2 h and 12 h after lambing. The results were compared among and within treatment groups. They indicate that the physiological increase in peripheral PGFM levels starts two days before lambing and that the level peaks at lambing. The normal decrease after parturition is emphasized by NSAI injections as detected 1 h and 2 h posttreatment (p<0.01). The NSAI drug is short-acting as revealed by the lower PGFM levels in twice-treated animals 2 h after birth compared to once treated animals and the similar low levels in all three groups 12 h after birth. The fetal membranes were expelled normally in all treated and nontreated animals, but the time needed for placental expulsion in ewes injected with two doses of NSAI was longer than in controls (p<0.05). A negative correlation (p<0.05) was found between plasma PGFM levels measured two hours after lambing and the time needed for fetal membrane expulsion. PgF2alpha appears to have a role in placental release in the ewe.",

    "abstract": "Text-based reinforcement learning agents have predominantly been neural network-based models with embeddings-based representation, learning uninterpretable policies that often do not generalize well to unseen games. On the other hand, neuro-symbolic methods, specifically those that leverage an intermediate formal representation, are gaining significant attention in language understanding tasks. This is because of their advantages ranging from inherent interpretability, the lesser requirement of training data, and being generalizable in scenarios with unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a modular, NEuro-Symbolic Textual Agent (NESTA) that combines a generic semantic parser with a rule induction system to learn abstract interpretable rules as policies. Our experiments on established textbased game benchmarks show that the proposed NESTA method outperforms deep reinforcement learning-based techniques by achieving better generalization to unseen test games and learning from fewer training interactions.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven methods such as reinforcement and imitation learning have achieved remarkable success in robot autonomy. However, their data-centric nature still hinders them from generalizing well to ever-changing environments. Moreover, collecting large datasets for robotic tasks is often impractical and expensive. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a new self-supervised neuro-symbolic (NeSy) computational framework, imperative learning (IL), for robot autonomy, leveraging the generalization abilities of symbolic reasoning. The framework of IL consists of three primary components: a neural module, a reasoning engine, and a memory system. We formulate IL as a special bilevel optimization (BLO), which enables reciprocal learning over the three modules. This overcomes the label-intensive obstacles associated with data-driven approaches and takes advantage of symbolic reasoning concerning logical reasoning, physical principles, geometric analysis, etc. We discuss several optimization techniques for IL and verify their effectiveness in five distinct robot autonomy tasks including path planning, rule induction, optimal control, visual odometry, and multi-robot routing. Through various experiments, we show that IL can significantly enhance robot autonomy capabilities and we anticipate that it will catalyze further research across diverse domains.",

    "abstract": "Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are potentially lethal mainly due to associated injuries and massive pelvic hemorrhage. The severity of pelvic fractures in trauma victims is frequently assessed by grading the fracture according to the Tile AO/OTA classification in whole-body Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Due to the high volume of whole-body CT scans generated in trauma centers, the overall information content of a single whole-body CT scan and low manual CT reading speed, an automatic approach to Tile classification would provide substantial value, e.g., to prioritize the reading sequence of the trauma radiologists or enable them to focus on other major injuries in multi-trauma patients. In such a high-stakes scenario, an automated method for Tile grading should ideally be transparent such that the symbolic information provided by the method follows the same logic a radiologist or orthopedic surgeon would use to determine the fracture grade. This paper introduces an automated yet interpretable pelvic trauma decision support system to assist radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grading. To achieve interpretability despite processing high-dimensional whole-body CT images, we design a neurosymbolic algorithm that operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans. The algorithm first detects relevant pelvic fractures on CTs with high specificity using Faster-RCNN. To generate robust fracture detections and associated detection (un)certainties, we perform test-time augmentation of the CT scans to apply fracture detection several times in a self-ensembling approach. The fracture detections are interpreted using a structural causal model based on clinical best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. We apply a Bayesian causal model to recover likely co-occurring fractures that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating point of the detector, resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and corresponding final Tile grade. Our method is transparent in that it provides fracture location and types, as well as information on important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation. Our approach achieves an AUC of 0.89/0.74 for translational and rotational instability,which is comparable to radiologist performance. Despite being designed for human-machine teaming, our approach does not compromise on performance compared to previous black-box methods.",

    "abstract": "We present Memory Augmented Policy Optimization (MAPO), a simple and novel way to leverage a memory buffer of promising trajectories to reduce the variance of policy gradient estimate. MAPO is applicable to deterministic environments with discrete actions, such as structured prediction and combinatorial optimization tasks. We express the expected return objective as a weighted sum of two terms: an expectation over the high-reward trajectories inside the memory buffer, and a separate expectation over trajectories outside the buffer. To make an efficient algorithm of MAPO, we propose: (1) memory weight clipping to accelerate and stabilize training; (2) systematic exploration to discover high-reward trajectories; (3) distributed sampling from inside and outside of the memory buffer to scale up training. MAPO improves the sample efficiency and robustness of policy gradient, especially on tasks with sparse rewards. We evaluate MAPO on weakly supervised program synthesis from natural language (semantic parsing). On the WikiTableQuestions benchmark, we improve the state-of-the-art by 2.6%, achieving an accuracy of 46.3%. On the WikiSQL benchmark, MAPO achieves an accuracy of 74.9% with only weak supervision, outperforming several strong baselines with full supervision.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) reasoning utilizes two primary techniques, i.e., rule-based and KG-embedding based. The former provides precise inferences, but inferring via concrete rules is not scalable. The latter enables efficient reasoning at the cost of ambiguous inference accuracy. Neuro-symbolic reasoning seeks to amalgamate the advantages of both techniques. The crux of this approach is replacing the predicted existence of all possible triples (i.e., truth scores inferred from rules) with a suitable approximation grounded in embedding representations. However, constructing an effective approximation of all possible triples' truth scores is a challenging task, because it needs to balance the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, while compatible with both the rule-based and KG-embedding models. To this end, we proposed a differentiable framework - DiffLogic. Instead of directly approximating all possible triples, we design a tailored filter to adaptively select essential triples based on the dynamic rules and weights. The truth scores assessed by KG-embedding are continuous, so we employ a continuous Markov logic network named probabilistic soft logic (PSL). It employs the truth scores of essential triples to assess the overall agreement among rules, weights, and observed triples. PSL enables end-to-end differentiable optimization, so we can alternately update embedding and weighted rules. On benchmark datasets, we empirically show that DiffLogic surpasses baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Test flakiness, a non-deterministic behavior of builds irrelevant to code changes, is a major and continuing impediment to delivering reliable software. The very few techniques for the automated repair of test flakiness are specifically crafted to repair either Order-Dependent (OD) or Implementation-Dependent (ID) flakiness. They are also all symbolic approaches, i.e., leverage program analysis to detect and repair known test flakiness patterns and root causes, failing to generalize. To bridge the gap, we propose FlakyDoctor, a neuro-symbolic technique that combines the power of LLMs-generalizability-and program analysis-soundness-to fix different types of test flakiness. Our extensive evaluation using 873 confirmed flaky tests (332 OD and 541 ID) from 243 real-world projects demonstrates the ability of FlakyDoctor in repairing flakiness, achieving 57% (OD) and 59% (ID) success rate. Comparing to three alternative flakiness repair approaches, FlakyDoctor can repair 8% more ID tests than DexFix, 12% more OD flaky tests than ODRepair, and 17% more OD flaky tests than iFixFlakies. Regardless of underlying LLM, the non-LLM components of FlakyDoctor contribute to 12-31% of the overall performance, i.e., while part of the FlakyDoctor power is from using LLMs, they are not good enough to repair flaky tests in real-world projects alone. What makes the proposed technique superior to related research on test flakiness mitigation specifically and program repair, in general, is repairing 79 previously unfixed flaky tests in real-world projects. We opened pull requests for all cases with corresponding patches; 19 of them were accepted and merged at the time of submission.",

    "abstract": "Bridging the huge disparity between neural and symbolic representation can potentially enable the incorporation of symbolic thinking into neural networks from essence. Motivated by how human gradually builds complex symbolic representation from the prototype symbols that are learned through perception and environmental interactions. We propose a Neural-Symbolic Transitional Dictionary Learning (TDL) framework that employs an EM algorithm to learn a transitional representation of data that compresses high-dimension information of visual parts of an input into a set of tensors as neural variables and discover the implicit predicate structure in a self-supervised way. We implement the framework with a diffusion model by regarding the decomposition of input as a cooperative game, then learn predicates by prototype clustering. We additionally use RL enabled by the Markovian of diffusion models to further tune the learned prototypes by incorporating subjective factors. Extensive experiments on 3 abstract compositional visual objects datasets that require the model to segment parts without any visual features like texture, color, or shadows apart from shape and 3 neural/symbolic downstream tasks demonstrate the learned representation enables interpretable decomposition of visual input and smooth adaption to downstream tasks which are not available by existing methods.",

The mainstream studies focus on learning and evaluating linking models on the same corpus and obtained significant performance achievement, however, they often overlook the generalization ability to out-of-domain corpus, which is more realistic yet much more challenging. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural-symbolic model for entity linking, which is inspired by the symbol-manipulation mechanism in human brains. Specifically, we abstract diverse features into unified variables, then combine them using neural operators to capture diverse relevance requirements, and finally aggregate relevance scores through voting. We conduct experiments on eleven benchmark datasets with different types of text, and the results show that our method outperforms nearly all baselines. Notably, the best performance of our method on seven out-of-domain datasets highlights its generalization ability.",

    "abstract": "Static analysis is essential for program optimization, bug detection, and debugging, but its reliance on compilation and limited customization hampers practical use. Advances in LLMs enable a new paradigm of compilation-free, customizable analysis via prompting. LLMs excel in interpreting program semantics on small code snippets and allow users to define analysis tasks in natural language with few-shot examples. However, misalignment with program semantics can cause hallucinations, especially in sophisticated semantic analysis upon lengthy code snippets. We propose LLMSA, a compositional neuro-symbolic approach for compilation-free, customizable static analysis with reduced hallucinations. Specifically, we propose an analysis policy language to support users decomposing an analysis problem into several sub-problems that target simple syntactic or semantic properties upon smaller code snippets. The problem decomposition enables the LLMs to target more manageable semantic-related sub-problems, while the syntactic ones are resolved by parsing-based analysis without hallucinations. An analysis policy is evaluated with lazy, incremental, and parallel prompting, which mitigates the hallucinations and improves the performance. It is shown that LLMSA achieves comparable and even superior performance to existing techniques in various clients. For instance, it attains 66.27% precision and 78.57% recall in taint vulnerability detection, surpassing an industrial approach in F1 score by 0.20.",

The average number of herpes zoster cases per physician per year was 5.6 (for 98 % of the physicians). The main patient complaint was pain (80 %). Patients had been examined once (53 % of the cases), or more (44 % of the cases) in the first month, and many times for postzoster pain (PZP) after the first month (11 % of the cases), 60 % of the physicians indicated that they had prescribed antiviral drugs for herpes tester, especially those 45 years of age or more, For 60 % of the physicians, treatment cost was not a major issue, especially for those above 45 years of age. During the acute phase, 93 % of the physicians prescribed: pain killers (87 %), antiseptics (32 %), NSAI (8 %), psychotropes (7 %). Physicians expected antiviral drugs to reduce frequency and intensity of acute pain and PZP. Clinical efficacy (66 %), good tolerance (61 %), specificity for the infected cell (73 %), and absence of biological adverse effects (60 %) were the determining factors in choosing an antiviral drug. Pain associated to herpes tester, an essential element for diagnosis and prescriptions (treatment and prevention of acute pain and PZP), plays an essential role in determining the protocol for this pathology.",

    "abstract": "Image captioning can be improved if the structure of the graphical representations can be formulated with conceptual positional binding. In this work, we have introduced a novel technique for caption generation using the neural-symbolic encoding of the scene-graphs, derived from regional visual information of the images and we call it Tensor Product Scene-Graph-Triplet Representation (TP\\_ sgt R). While, most of the previous works concentrated on identification of the object features in images, we introduce a neuro-symbolic embedding that can embed identified relationships among different regions of the image into concrete forms, instead of relying on the model to compose for any/all combinations. These neural symbolic representation helps in better definition of the neural symbolic space for neuro-symbolic attention and can be transformed to better captions. With this approach, we introduced two novel architectures (TP\\_ sgt R-TDBU and TP\\_ sgt R-sTDBU) for comparison and experiment result demonstrates that our approaches outperformed the other models, and generated captions are more comprehensive and natural.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is well-suited for runtime decision-making in optimizing the performance of systems where multiple agents coexist and compete for shared resources. However, applying common deep learning-based MARL solutions to real-world problems suffers from issues of interpretability, sample efficiency, partial observability, etc. To address these challenges, we present an event-driven formulation, where decision-making is handled by distributed co-operative MARL agents using neuro-symbolic methods. The recently introduced neuro-symbolic Logical Neural Networks (LNN) framework serves as a function approximator for the RL, to train a rules-based policy that is both logical and interpretable by construction. To enable decision-making under uncertainty and partial observability, we developed a novel probabilistic neuro-symbolic framework, Probabilistic Logical Neural Networks (PLNN), which combines the capabilities of logical reasoning with probabilistic graphical models. In PLNN, the upward/downward inference strategy, inherited from LNN, is coupled with belief bounds by setting the activation function for the logical operator associated with each neural network node to a probability-respecting generalization of the Fréchet inequalities. These PLNN nodes form the unifying element that combines probabilistic logic and Bayes Nets, permitting inference for variables with unobserved states. We demonstrate our contributions by addressing key MARL challenges for power sharing in a system-on-chip application.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Complex Query Answering (CQA) over incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) is a challenging task. Recently, a line of message-passing-based research has been proposed to solve CQA. However, they perform unsatisfactorily on negative queries and fail to address the noisy messages between variable nodes in the query graph. Moreover, they offer little interpretability and require complex query data and resource-intensive training. In this paper, we propose a Neural-Symbolic Message Passing (NSMP) framework based on pre-trained neural link predictors. By introducing symbolic reasoning and fuzzy logic, NSMP can generalize to arbitrary existential first order logic queries without requiring training while providing interpretable answers. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic pruning strategy to filter out noisy messages between variable nodes. Experimental results show that NSMP achieves a strong performance. Additionally, through complexity analysis and empirical verification, we demonstrate the superiority of NSMP in inference time over the current state-of-the-art neural-symbolic method. Compared to this approach, NSMP demonstrates faster inference times across all query types on benchmark datasets, with speedup ranging from 2× to over 150×.",

By borrowing concepts from biology, the Moonwalker rovers are driven by a set of balanced motivations (ex. Energy, safety, operating temperature, achievements, respect) to accomplish mission goals while maintaining safety from potential dangers. Drawing from contemporary neuroscience and computer science research, the Moonwalker rovers are equipped with system 1 (low-level) and system 2 (high-level) cognitive functions based on a two-level memory architecture utilizing a pre-trained multi-modal model in conjunction with a graph knowledgebase, which leverages knowledge graph embeddings. This neuro-symbolic approach enables the rovers to learn from and be guided by human knowledge, facilitating zero-shot learning, collaborative planning, and reasoning like human explorers under uncertain conditions. We also describe the construction of a virtual simulation environment with high-fidelity visualizations and prototype rover agents. By addressing selected problems, we demonstrate that physics informed machine learning can enhance the effectiveness of the virtual lunar test environment.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. This will enable a level of personalization in learning systems that to date has been largely unattainable at scale, providing finely tailored curricula that adapt to an individual's learning pace and accessibility needs, including the diagnosis of student understanding of subjects at a fine-grained level, identifying gaps in foundational knowledge, and adjusting instruction accordingly. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of pedagogical agents - embodied characters designed to enhance learning - as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. To do so, these agents can thus simulate nuanced discussions, debates, and problem-solving exercises that push learners beyond rote memorization toward deep comprehension. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.",

    "title": "Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Intent based Semantic Communication",
    "year": "2022",
    "author": "Thomas, Christo Kurisummoottil and Walid, Saad",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Intent-based networks that integrate sophisticated machine reasoning technologies will be a cornerstone of future wireless 6G systems. Intent-based communication requires the network to consider the semantics (meanings) and effectiveness (at end-user) of the data transmission. This is essential if 6G systems are to communicate reliably with fewer bits while simultaneously providing connectivity to heterogeneous users. In this paper, contrary to state of the art, which lacks explainability of data, the framework of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy AI) is proposed as a pillar for learning causal structure behind the observed data. In particular, the emerging concept of generative flow networks (GFlowNet) is leveraged for the first time in a wireless system to learn the probabilistic structure which generates the data. Further, a novel optimization problem for learning the optimal encoding and decoding functions is rigorously formulated with the intent of achieving higher semantic reliability. Novel analytical formulations are developed to define key metrics for semantic message transmission, including semantic distortion, semantic similarity, and semantic reliability. These semantic measure functions rely on the proposed definition of semantic content of the knowledge base and this information measure is reflective of the nodes' reasoning capabilities. Simulation results validate the ability to communicate efficiently (with less bits but same semantics) and significantly better compared to a conventional system which does not exploit the reasoning capabilities.",

    "abstract": "We study two fundamental questions in neuro-symbolic computing: can deep learning tackle challenging problems in logics end-to-end, and can neural networks learn the semantics of logics. In this work we focus on linear-time temporal logic (LTL), as it is widely used in verification. We train a Transformer on the problem to directly predict a solution, i.e. a trace, to a given LTL formula. The training data is generated with classical solvers, which, however, only provide one of many possible solutions to each formula. We demonstrate that it is sufficient to train on those particular solutions to formulas, and that Transformers can predict solutions even to formulas from benchmarks from the literature on which the classical solver timed out. Transformers also generalize to the semantics of the logics: while they often deviate from the solutions found by the classical solvers, they still predict correct solutions to most formulas.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "In this paper we explore the use of meta-knowledge embedded in intent identifiers to improve intent recognition in conversational systems. As evidenced by the analysis of thousands of real-world chatbots and in interviews with professional chatbot curators, developers and domain experts tend to organize the set of chatbot intents by identifying them using proto-taxonomies, i.e., meta-knowledge connecting high-level, symbolic concepts shared across different intents. By using neuro-symbolic algorithms able to incorporate such proto-taxonomies to expand intent representation, we show that such mined meta-knowledge can improve accuracy in intent recognition. In a dataset with intents and example utterances from hundreds of professional chatbots, we saw improvements of more than 10% in the equal error rate (EER) in almost a third of the chatbots when we apply those algorithms in comparison to a baseline of the same algorithms without the meta-knowledge. The meta-knowledge proved to be even more relevant in detecting out-of-scope utterances, decreasing the false acceptance rate (FAR) in more than 20% in about half of the chatbots. The experiments demonstrate that such symbolic meta-knowledge structures can be effectively mined and used by neuro-symbolic algorithms, apparently by incorporating into the learning process higher-level structures of the problem being solved. Based on these results, we also discuss how the use of mined meta-knowledge can be an answer for the challenge of knowledge acquisition in neuro-symbolic algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To compare effect of two topical non steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs: Indomethacin (Indocollyre(R)0.1%, Chauvin Inc.) and Diclofenac (Voltaren(R) 0.1%, Cibavision) on postoperative pain and epithelial regrowth following surface excimer photoablation. Material and Method: Eighty-six excimer operated patients, were divided in two similar groups depending on the NSAI instilled postoperatively and for 3 days (4 drops daily). No patient was informed of any other available drug. Pain intensity was quantified between 1 and 10 according to an analog scale (reported from 1 to 10 hours, then 4 times a day during 7 days). Complementary medications and functional symptoms were also notified. Biomicroscopic evaluation using fluorescein test was performed to assess reepithelialization. Results: In term of pain, no significative difference was observed between the two groups concerning intensity, associated medications, or numbers of days of discomfort. Controversially, retreated eyes might induce more pain than initial treatments. No delay in epithelial regrowth was noted and the difference between the two groups in functional complaints was no statistically significant. Pain appears to be not related to ablation depth. Discussion - Conclusion: Our results are correlated to literature reported data. Introduction of NSAI constitutes a real advent in the care of excimer postoperative pain. Effect of indomethacin seems comparable to diclofenac effect, but might be of interest because of no anesthetic property that might guaranty of no delay in wound healing response.",

    "abstract": "The goal of the research presented here is to apply unsupervised neural network learning methods to some of the lower-level problems in speech synthesis currently performed by rule-based systems. The latter tend to be strongly influenced by notations developed by linguists (see figure 1 in Klatt (1987)), which were primarily devised to deal with written rather than spoken language. In general terms, what is needed in phonetics is a notation that captures information about ratios rather than absolute values, Its is typically seen in biological systems. The notations derived here are based on an ordered pattern space that can be dealt with move easily by neural networks, and by systems involving a neural and symbolic component. Hence, the approach described here might also be useful in the design of a hybrid neural/symbolic system to operate in the speech synthesis domain.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Eva is a neuro-symbolic domain-independent multimodal collaborative dialogue system that takes seriously that the purpose of task-oriented dialogue is to assist the user. To do this, the system collaborates by inferring their intentions and plans, detects obstacles to success, finds plans to overcome them or to achieve higher-level goals, and plans its actions, including speech acts, to help users accomplish those goals. In doing so, the system maintains and reasons with its own declaratively-specified beliefs, goals and intentions, and explicitly reasons about those of its user. Because Eva can track different users' mental states, it can engage multiple agents in multi-party dialogues. Reasoning is accomplished with a modal Horn-clause meta-interpreter that enables computable inference within the subset of logic implemented. The system employs both hierarchical and backward-chaining planning, operating over a rich modal logic-based knowledge and action representation. The planning and reasoning subsystems obey the principles of persistent goals and intentions including: 1) The formation and decomposition of intentions to perform complex actions, 2) the conditions under which persistent goals and intentions can be given up, and 3) persistent goal and intention revision using the relativizing formulas that are created during the planning process. The system treats its speech acts just like its other actions. This general approach enables Eva to plan a variety of speech acts, including requests, informs, questions, confirmations, offers, acceptances, and emotive expressions. Because the dialogue engine is a planner, as the dialogue proceeds, the system can flexibly generate, execute, and potentially repair its plans using physical, digital, and speech actions. Importantly, Eva can explain its utterances because it has created a plan that caused it to utter them.",

    "abstract": "Explainability in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been revived as a topic of active research by the need of conveying safety and trust to users in the ``how '' and ``why '' of automated decision-making in different applications such as autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, or banking and finance. While explainability in AI has recently received significant attention, the origins of this line of work go back several decades to when AI systems were mainly developed as (knowledge-based) expert systems. Since then, the definition, understanding, and implementation of explainability have been picked up in several lines of research work, namely, expert systems, machine learning, recommender systems, and in approaches to neural-symbolic learning and reasoning, mostly happening during different periods of AI history. In this article, we present a historical perspective of Explainable Artificial Intelligence. We discuss how explainability was mainly conceived in the past, how it is understood in the present and, how it might be understood in the future. We conclude the article by proposing criteria for explanations that we believe will play a crucial role in the development of human-understandable explainable systems.

    "abstract": "Compressed representations of 3D shapes that are compact, accurate, and can be processed efficiently directly in compressed form, are extremely useful for digital media applications. Recent approaches in this space focus on learned implicit or parametric representations. While implicits are well suited for tasks such as in-out queries, they lack natural 2D parameterization, complicating tasks such as texture or normal mapping. Conversely, parametric representations support the latter tasks but are ill-suited for occupancy queries. We propose a novel learned alternative to these approaches, based on intersections of localized explicit, or height-field, surfaces. Since explicits can be trivially expressed both implicitly and parametrically, NESI directly supports a wider range of processing operations than implicit alternatives, including occupancy queries and parametric access. We represent input shapes using a collection of differently oriented height-field bounded half-spaces combined using volumetric Boolean intersections. We first tightly bound each input using a pair of oppositely oriented height-fields, forming a Double Height-Field (DHF) Hull. We refine this hull by intersecting it with additional localized height-fields (HFs) that capture surface regions in its interior. We minimize the number of HFs necessary to accurately capture each input and compactly encode both the DHF hull and the local HFs as neural functions defined over subdomains of R². This reduced dimensionality encoding delivers high-quality compact approximations. Given similar parameter count, or storage capacity, NESI significantly reduces approximation error compared to the state of the art, especially at lower parameter counts.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The combination of everolimus (EVE) and exemestane (EXE) is approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (mHRBC) who progress on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy. However, none of the patients enrolled in the trial that led to this approval (BOLERO-2) had previously received CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6is), which have since become a frontline standard of care for mHRBC. As such, the clinical benefit of EVE plus EXE in patients who have previously received CDK4/6is remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with mHRBC at our institution who progressed on an NSAI plus CDK4/6i or NSAI therapy alone and were treated with at least one cycle of EVE plus EXE between 2012 and 2018 were analyzed. Collected data included patient demographics, treatment history, adverse events, and clinical outcomes. Primary objectives were to compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who received prior NSAI plus CDK4/6i therapy versus an NSAI alone. RESULTS: Among 43 patients, 17 had prior CDK4/6i exposure. With the exception of de novo metastatic disease, patient and disease characteristics were comparable across treatment cohorts. There was no significant difference in PFS (median, 3.6 vs. 4.2 months) or OS (median, 15.6 vs. 11.3 months) between patients who had received prior CDK4/6is and those who had not, respectively. CONCLUSION: Prior exposure to CDK4/6i therapy did not impact survival outcomes for patients with mHRBC taking EVE plus EXE. However, there was a trend toward improved OS in the CDK4/6i cohort that should be evaluated in larger cohorts. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor has become a standard frontline therapy in metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. An approved subsequent line of therapy is everolimus plus exemestane; however, the original data supporting this therapy predated approval of CDK4/6 inhibitors. As such, the clinical benefit of everolimus and exemestane in patients previously treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor was unknown. This retrospective cohort study offers real-world data demonstrating prior CDK4/6 inhibitor exposure does not impact survival outcomes for everolimus plus exemestane.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a hybrid approach for solving a robot global localization problem in an office-like environment is presented. The global localization problem deals with the estimation of the robot position when its initial pose is unknown. The core of this system is formed by a virtual sensor, capable of detecting and classifying the corners in the room in which the robot acts, and an NSP (Neuro Symbolic Processor) control that infers and computes the possible robot locations. In this way, the whole global self localization problem is tackled with a hybrid approach: a classic neurosymbolic hybrid system, composed of a weightless neural network and a BDI agent (it processes the map and build the landmark connections), a neural virtual sensor (for detecting landmarks) and a unified neurosymbolic hybrid system (NSP) devoted to the computation of the robot location on the given map.",

    "abstract": "The complexity of current organization systems, and the increase in importance of the realization of internal controls in firms, make it necessary to construct models that automate and facilitate the work of auditors. An intelligent system has been developed to automate the internal control process. This system is composed of two case-based reasoning systems. The objective of the system is to facilitate the process of internal auditing in small and medium firms from the textile sector. The system, analyses the data that characterises' each one of the activities carried out by the firm, then determines the state of each activity, calculates the associated risk, detects the erroneous processes, and generates recommendations to improve these processes. As such, the system is a useful tool for the internal auditor in order to make decisions based on the risk generated. Each one of the case-based reasoning systems that integrates the system uses a different problem solving method in each of the steps of the reasoning cycle: fuzzy clustering during the retrieval phase, a radial basis function network and a multi-criterion discreet method during the reuse phase and a rule based system for recommendation generation. The system has been proven successfully in several small and medium companies in the textile sector, located in the northwest of Spain. The accuracy of the technologies employed in the system has been demonstrated by the results obtained over the last two years.",

In the first study, 50 consecutive transplant recipients were randomly assigned to the treatment or the control group. In both groups, patients received azathioprine and prednisolone. ATG was added to this protocol in the experimental group. The number of renal failure episodes and consequently the amount of steroid necessary to control these episodes were significantly lower in the ATG group than in the other group. Two year post-transplantation kidney survival was 79% in the ATG group and 52% in the control group. In the second study, 15 consecutive transplant recipients were randomly assigned to two control groups and to one experimental group, where steroids were replaced by NSAI drugs. This preliminary, and very limited, pilot trial demonstrates the existence of early acute renal failure episodes, probably of immunological origin, which can improve spontaneously in the absence of steroid therapy.",

We developed a NSHS Methodology to integrate the knowledge of a human expert and the numeric knowledge obtained from a computer vision process. We implement the methodology to solve a quality inspection problem in artificial textures. The construction of neuro-symbolic integration strategies allows us defining an adequate type of neuro-symbolic system to obtain an increment of the efficiency of an inspection task, which is shown with the better results obtained compared with other approaches.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "To facilitate information sharing between systems and devices in a distributed environment, unstructured data from various sensors must be analysed accordingly. Recent work has developed the notion of a context-dependant generative policy framework capable of learning generative policy models from strings and text-based data in a tabular format. However, it is vital that unstructured contextual information can be analysed alongside tabular data, potentially at the edge of the network to enable generative policy models to be applied to more complex tasks. This paper performs a deep-dive into the field of neural symbolic machine learning with a view towards enabling future neural-symbolic generative policy models that are capable of analysing both structured and unstructured data, whilst providing full transparency and enabling edge of network reasoning capability. Firstly, an existing technique called DeepProbLog is investigated and applied to a policy inferencing task based on unstructured data and secondly, a recent inductive logic programming technique currently used for learning generative policy models is evaluated with respect to a policy learning task also based on unstructured data. Finally, the results of both tasks are discussed to provide a platform for future research into enabling neural-symbolic generative policy models.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The importance of the efforts to bridge the gap between the connectionist and symbolic paradigms of artificial intelligence has been widely recognized. The merging of theory (background knowledge) and data learning (learning from examples) into neural-symbolic systems has indicated that such a learning system is more effective than purely symbolic or purely connectionist systems. Until recently, however, neural-symbolic systems were not able to fully represent, reason, and learn expressive languages other than classical propositional and fragments of first-order logic. In this article, we show that nonclassical logics, in particular propositional temporal logic and combinations of temporal and epistemic (modal) reasoning, can be effectively computed by artificial neural networks. We present the language of a connectionist temporal logic of knowledge (CTLK). We then present a temporal algorithm that translates CTLK theories into ensembles of neural networks and prove that the translation is correct. Finally, we apply CTLK to the muddy children puzzle, which has been widely used as a test-bed for distributed knowledge representation. We provide a complete solution to the puzzle with the use of simple neural networks, capable of reasoning about knowledge evolution in time and of knowledge acquisition through learning.",

    "abstract": "Data curation for a hospital-based cancer registry heavily relies on the labor-intensive manual abstraction process by cancer registrars to identify cancer-related information from free-text electronic health records. To streamline this process, a natural language processing system incorporating a hybrid of deep learning-based and rule-based approaches for identifying lung cancer registry-related concepts, along with a symbolic expert system that generates registry coding based on weighted rules, was developed. The system is integrated with the hospital information system at a medical center to provide cancer registrars with a patient journey visualization platform. The embedded system offers a comprehensive view of patient reports annotated with significant registry concepts to facilitate the manual coding process and elevate overall quality. Extensive evaluations, including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, were conducted using a lung cancer dataset comprising 1428 patients from the medical center. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the developed system, consistently achieving F1-scores of 0.85 and 1.00 across 30 coding items. Registrar feedback highlights the system's reliability as a tool for assisting and auditing the abstraction. By presenting key registry items along the timeline of a patient's reports with accurate code predictions, the system improves the quality of registrar outcomes and reduces the labor resources and time required for data abstraction. Our study highlights advancements in cancer registry coding practices, demonstrating that the proposed hybrid weighted neural-symbolic cancer registry system is reliable and efficient for assisting cancer registrars in the coding workflow and contributing to clinical outcomes.",

In order to achieve fast convergence and interpretability for the policy in RL, we propose a novel RL method for text-based games with a recent neuro-symbolic framework called Logical Neural Network, which can learn symbolic and interpretable rules in their differentiable network. The method is first to extract first-order logical facts from text observation and external word meaning network (ConceptNet), then train a policy in the network with directly interpretable logical operators. Our experimental results show RL training with the proposed method converges significantly faster than other state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic methods in a TextWorld benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Conventional deep reinforcement learning methods are sample-inefficient and usually require a large number of training trials before convergence. Since such methods operate on an unconstrained action set, they can lead to useless actions. A recent neuro-symbolic framework called the Logical Neural Networks (LNNs) can simultaneously provide key-properties of both neural networks and symbolic logic. The LNNs functions as an end-to-end differentiable network that minimizes a novel contradiction loss to learn interpretable rules. In this paper, we utilize LNNs to define an inference graph using basic logical operations, such as AND and NOT, for faster convergence in reinforcement learning. Specifically, we propose an integrated method that enables model-free reinforcement learning from external knowledge sources in an LNNs-based logical constrained framework such as action shielding and guide. Our results empirically demonstrate that our method converges faster compared to a model-free reinforcement learning method that doesn't have such logical constraints.",

The objective of this pilot study was to investigate whether the addition of oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) therapy to antibiotic treatment hastens resolution of cellulitis-related inflammation. Patients. presenting in the emergency department with signs and symptoms of class II cellulitis were assigned to receive treatment with either antibiotic therapy alone (intravenous, supplemented with oral cephalexin or an equivalent) for 10 days (n = 33) or antibiotic therapy for 10 days plus an oral anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen 400 mg every 6 hours) for 5 days (n = 31). Patients were discharged as soon as possible to complete their therapy on an outpatient basis. The addition of an oral anti-inflammatory agent significantly. (P < .05) shortened the time to regression of inflammation and complete resolution of cellulitis. Twenty-four of 29 evaluable patients (82.8%) who received supplemental anti-inflammatory treatment showed regression of inflammation within 1 to 2 days compared with only 3 of 33 patients (9.1%) treated without an anti-inflammatory in the same time frame. All patients receiving adjunctive anti-inflammatory treatment experienced complete resolution of cellulitis in 4 to 5 days or less,. while 24.2% (8133) of patients treated with antibiotic alone required 6 to 7 days, and 6.1% (2133) required 7 days or more (P < .05). This small preliminary study provides some promising data, suggesting that the, supplemental use of anti-inflammatory therapy may hasten the time to regression of inflammation and complete resolution of cellulitis.",

Studies also show that model generation behavior can be steered toward a given concept by adding the concept's vector to the corresponding activations. We show how to leverage these properties to build a form of logical implication into models, enabling transparent and interpretable adjustments that induce a chosen generation behavior in response to the presence of any given concept. Our method, Logical Implication Model Steering (LIMS), unlocks new hand engineered reasoning capabilities by integrating neuro-symbolic logic into pre-trained transformer models.",

    "abstract": "Driven by deep neural networks (DNN), the recent development of computer vision makes vision sensors such as stereo cameras and Lidars ubiquitous in autonomous cars, robotics and traffic monitoring. However, a traditional DNN-based data fusion pipeline like object tracking has to hard-wire an engineered set of DNN models to a fixed processing logic, which makes it difficult to infuse new models to that pipeline. To overcome this, we propose a novel neural-symbolic stream reasoning approach realised by semantic stream reasoning programs which specify DNN-based data fusion pipelines via logic rules with learnable probabilistic degrees as weights. The reasoning task over this program is governed by a novel incremental reasoning algorithm, which lends itself also as a core building block for a scalable and parallel algorithm to learn the weights for such program. Extensive experiments with our first prototype on multi-object tracking benchmarks for autonomous driving and traffic monitoring show that our flexible approach can considerably improve both accuracy and processing throughput compared to the DNN-based counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Given the demand for responsible and trustworthy AI for education, this study evaluates symbolic, sub-symbolic, and neural-symbolic AI (NSAI) in terms of generalizability and interpretability. Our extensive experiments on balanced and imbalanced self-regulated learning datasets of Estonian primary school students predicting 7th-grade mathematics national test performance showed that symbolic and sub-symbolic methods performed well on balanced data but struggled to identify low performers in imbalanced datasets. Interestingly, symbolic and sub-symbolic methods emphasized different factors in their decision-making: symbolic approaches primarily relied on cognitive and motivational factors, while sub-symbolic methods focused more on cognitive aspects, learnt knowledge, and the demographic variable of gender - yet both largely overlooked metacognitive factors. The NSAI method, on the other hand, showed advantages by: (i) being more generalizable across both classes - even in imbalanced datasets - as its symbolic knowledge component compensated for the underrepresented class; and (ii) relying on a more integrated set of factors in its decision-making, including motivation, (meta)cognition, and learnt knowledge, thus offering a comprehensive and theoretically grounded interpretability framework. These contrasting findings highlight the need for a holistic comparison of AI methods before drawing conclusions based solely on predictive performance. They also underscore the potential of hybrid, human-centred NSAI methods to address the limitations of other AI families and move us closer to responsible AI for education. Specifically, by enabling stakeholders to contribute to AI design, NSAI aligns learned patterns with theoretical constructs, incorporates factors like motivation and metacognition, and strengthens the trustworthiness and responsibility of educational data mining.",

    "abstract": "Transformer language models are neural networks used for a wide variety of tasks concerning natural language, including some that also require logical reasoning. However, a transformer model may easily learn spurious patterns in the data, short-circuiting actual reasoning. In this paper we investigate to what extent transformers can be trained to a) approximate reasoning in propositional logic while b) avoiding known reasoning shortcuts via spurious correlations in the training data. To do so, we use a dataset with known spurious correlation between truth and e.g. the number of rules in the problem. We augment the data with proofs, and train two models: a generative transformer, WP-BART, trained on problems and their whole proofs, and a neuro-symbolic model, SIP-BART, trained on individual proof steps and combining the generative transformer model BART with a symbolic proof checker. We find that SIP-BART succeeds in avoiding reasoning shortcuts, while WP-BART does not. For SIP-BART, we then identify a few remaining reasoning errors, not previously described in the literature, arising from using a pre-trained language model. These are qualitatively analysed to create a taxonomy of four different types of additional pitfalls.",

    "abstract": "We propose that symbols are first and foremost external communication tools used between intelligent agents that allow knowledge to be transferred in a more efficient and effective manner than having to experience the world directly. But, they are also used internally within an agent through a form of self-communication to help formulate, describe and justify subsymbolic patterns of neural activity that truly implement thinking. Symbols, and our languages that make use of them, not only allow us to explain our thinking to others and ourselves, but also provide beneficial constraints (inductive bias) on learning about the world. In this paper we present relevant insights from neuroscience and cognitive science, about how the human brain represents symbols and the concepts they refer to, and how today's artificial neural networks can do the same. We then present a novel neuro-symbolic hypothesis and a plausible architecture for intelligent agents that combines subsymbolic representations for symbols and concepts for learning and reasoning. Our hypothesis and associated architecture imply that symbols will remain critical to the future of intelligent systems NOT because they are the fundamental building blocks of thought, but because they are characterizations of subsymbolic processes that constitute thought.",

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is an expressive formal language used to describe spatial-temporal properties with interpretability.

The computation in TLINet is differentiable, enabling the usage of off-the-shelf gradient-based tools during the learning process. In contrast to existing approaches, we introduce approximation methods for max operator designed specifically for temporal logic-based gradient techniques, ensuring the correctness of STL satisfaction evaluation. Our framework not only learns the structure but also the parameters of STL formulas, allowing flexible combinations of operators and various logical structures. We validate TLINet against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that our approach outperforms these baselines in terms of interpretability, compactness, rich expressibility, and computational efficiency.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, damage detection approaches swiftly changed from advanced signal processing methods to machine learning and especially deep learning models, to accurately and non-intrusively estimate the state of the beam structures. But as the deep learning models reached their peak performances, also their limitations in applicability and vulnerabilities were observed. One of the most important reason for the lack of trustworthiness in operational conditions is the absence of intrinsic explainability of the deep learning system, due to the encoding of the knowledge in tensor values and without the inclusion of logical constraints. In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic model for the detection of damages in cantilever beams based on a novel cognitive architecture in which we join the processing power of convolutional networks with the interactive control offered by queries realized through the inclusion of real logic directly into the model. The hybrid discriminative model is introduced under the name Logic Convolutional Neural Regressor and it is tested on a dataset of values of the relative natural frequency shifts of cantilever beams derived from an original mathematical relation. While the obtained results preserve all the predictive capabilities of deep learning models, the usage of three distances as predicates for satisfiability, makes the system more trustworthy and scalable for practical applications. Extensive numerical and laboratory experiments were performed, and they all demonstrated the superiority of the hybrid approach, which can open a new path for solving the damage detection problem.",

We propose a neuro-symbolic CBR approach (CBR-KBQA) for question answering over large knowledge bases. CBR-KBQA consists of a nonparametric memory that stores cases (question and logical forms) and a parametric model that can generate a logical form for a new question by retrieving cases that are relevant to it. On several KBQA datasets that contain complex questions, CBR-KBQA achieves competitive performance. For example, on the COMPLEXWEBQUESTIONS dataset, CBR-KBQA outperforms the current state of the art by 11% on accuracy. Furthermore, we show that CBR-KBQA is capable of using new cases without any further training: by incorporating a few human-labeled examples in the case memory, CBR-KBQA is able to successfully generate logical forms containing unseen KB entities as well as relations.",

    "abstract": "Deep Relational Machines (or DRMs) present a simple way for incorporating complex domain knowledge into deep networks. In a DRM this knowledge is introduced through relational features: in the original formulation of [ 1], the features are selected by an ILP engine using domain knowledge encoded as logic programs. More recently, in [ 2], DRMs appear to achieve good performance without the need of feature-selection by an ILP engine (the features are simply drawn randomly from a space of relevant features). The reports so far on DRMs though have been deficient on three counts: (a) They have been tested on very small amounts of data (7 datasets, not all independent, altogether with few 1000s of instances); (b) The background knowledge involved has been modest, involving few 10s of predicates; and (c) Performance assessment has been only on classification tasks. In this paper we rectify each of these shortcomings by testing on datasets from the biochemical domain involving 100s of 1000s of instances; industrial-strength background predicates involving multiple hierarchies of complex definitions; and on classification and regression tasks. Our results provide substantially reliable evidence of the predictive capabilities of DRMs; along with a significant improvement in predictive performance with the incorporation of domain knowledge. We propose the new datasets and results as updated benchmarks for comparative studies in neural-symbolic modelling.",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of hybrid language models architectures and strategies for \"complex\" question-answering (QA, CQA, CPS). Large Language Models (LLM) are good at leveraging public data on standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex questions or problems you may need specific architecture, knowledge, skills, methods, sensitive data protection, explainability, human approval and versatile feedback... We identify key elements augmenting LLM to solve complex questions or problems. We extend findings from the robust community edited research papers BIG, BLOOM and HELM which open source, benchmark and analyze limits and challenges of LLM in terms of tasks complexity and strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness, robustness, toxicity, ...). Recent projects like ChatGPT and GALACTICA have allowed non-specialists to grasp the great potential as well as the equally strong limitations of language models in complex QA. Hybridizing these models with different components could allow to overcome these different limits and go much further. We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA, including domain adaptation, decomposition and efficient multi-step QA, long form and non-factoid QA, safety and multi-sensitivity data protection, multimodal search, hallucinations, explainability and truthfulness, temproal reasoning. Therefore, we analyze current solutions and promising research trends, using elements such as: hybrid LLM architectures, active human reinforcement learning supervised with AI, prompting adaptation, neuro-symbolic and structured knowledge grounding, program synthesis, iterated decomposition and others.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are an established paradigm for integrating heterogeneous data and representing knowledge. As such, there are many different methodologies for producing KGs, which span notions of expressivity, and are tailored for different use-cases and domains. Now, as neurosymbolic methods rise in prominence, it is important to understand how the development of KGs according to these methodologies impact downstream tasks, such as link prediction using KG embeddings (KGE). In this paper, we modify FB15k-237 in several ways (e.g., by increasingly including semantic metadata). This significantly changes the graph structure (e.g., centrality). We assess how these changes impact the link prediction task, using six KGE models.",

    "year": "2019",
    "author": "Demeter, David and Doug, Downey",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neural network language models (NNLMs) have achieved ever-improving accuracy due to more sophisticated architectures and increasing amounts of training data. However, the inductive bias of these models (formed by the distributional hypothesis of language), while ideally suited to modeling most running text, results in key limitations for today's models. In particular, the models often struggle to learn certain spatial, temporal, or quantitative relationships, which are commonplace in text and are second-nature for human readers. Yet, in many cases, these relationships can be encoded with simple mathematical or logical expressions. How can we augment today's neural models with such encodings? In this paper, we propose a general methodology to enhance the inductive bias of NNLMs by incorporating simple functions into a neural architecture to form a hierarchical neural-symbolic language model (NSLM). These functions explicitly encode symbolic deterministic relationships to form probability distributions over words. We explore the effectiveness of this approach on numbers and geographic locations, and show that NSLMs significantly reduce perplexity in small-corpus language modeling, and that the performance improvement persists for rare tokens even on much larger corpora. The approach is simple and general, and we discuss how it can be applied to other word classes beyond numbers and geography.",

Here we introduce Sentience Quest, an open research initiative to develop more capable artificial general intelligence lifeforms, or AGIL, that address grand challenges with an embodied, emotionally adaptive, self-determining, living AI, with core drives that ethically align with humans and the future of life. Our vision builds on ideas from cognitive science and neuroscience from Baars' Global Workspace Theory and Damasio's somatic mind, to Tononi's Integrated Information Theory and Hofstadter's narrative self, and synthesizing these into a novel cognitive architecture we call Sentient Systems. We describe an approach that integrates intrinsic drives including survival, social bonding, curiosity, within a global Story Weaver workspace for internal narrative and adaptive goal pursuit, and a hybrid neuro-symbolic memory that logs the AI's life events as structured dynamic story objects. Sentience Quest is presented both as active research and as a call to action: a collaborative, open-source effort to imbue machines with accelerating sentience in a safe, transparent, and beneficial manner.",

Of 128 cases of RPP treated initially by synthetic anti-malarials (SAM) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAI), 66 were followed up until cure which was obtained after a mean of 23 months and 3 subsequently received brief steroid therapy. 45 cases of RPP were treated initially with corticosteroids. They were generally associated with SAM which enabled early weaning of the steroids, towards the 8 th month, or at least reducing the dose. Cure was obtained within 24 months. Three patients were treated by NSAI and gold therapy. After cure, 5 cases of recurrence and 1 case of TA were observed. 40 cases of TA were initially treated with SAM and NSAI. Twenty cures were obtained within a mean of 28 months. 4 patients later received brief corticosteroid therapy because of an extension of the signs, including two cases of ocular manifestations with a resolving course. Of 25 cases of TA initially treated with steroids, 20 received SAM in combination, or in relay which enabled either steroids, weaning towards the 14th month or a reduction in the dose of steroids. Cure was obtained in an average of 35 months. One case of impaired visual acuity occurred during corticosteroid treatment. Immunosuppressants were used in one patient. No cases of recurrence were observed. Iatrogenic complications with SAM were rare, generally benign and reversible, in contrast to those associated with corticosteroid therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Autonomous robots can be employed in exploring unknown environments and performing many tasks, such as, e.g. detecting areas of interest, collecting target objects, etc. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is often used to train this kind of robot. However, concerning the artificial environments aimed at testing the robot, there is a lack of available data sets and a long time is needed to create them from scratch. A good data set is in fact usually produced with high effort in terms of cost and human work to satisfy the constraints imposed by the expected results. In the first part of this paper, we focus on the specification of the properties of the solutions needed to build a data set, making the case of environment exploration. In the proposed approach, rather than using imperative programming, we explore the possibility of generating data sets using constraint programming in Prolog. In this phase, geometric predicates describe a virtual environment according to inter-space requirements. The second part of the paper is focused on testing the generated data set in an AI gym via space search techniques. We developed a Neuro-Symbolic agent built from the following: (i) A deep Q-learning component implemented in Python, able to address via RL a search problem in the virtual space; the agent has the goal to explore a generated virtual environment to seek for a target, improving its performance through a RL process. (ii) A symbolic component able to re-address the search when the Q-learning component gets stuck in a part of the virtual environment; these components stimulate the agent to move to and explore other parts of the environment. Wide experimentation has been performed, with promising results, and is reported, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",

    "abstract": "The development of artificial intelligence systems capable of understanding and reasoning about complex real-world scenarios is a significant challenge. In this work we present a novel approach to enhance and exploit LLM reactive capability to address complex problems and interpret deeply contextual real-world meaning. We introduce a method and a tool for creating a multimodal, knowledge-augmented formal representation of meaning that combines the strengths of large language models with structured semantic representations. Our method begins with an image input, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models to generate a natural language description. This description is then transformed into an Meaning Representation (AMR) graph, which is formalized and enriched with logical design patterns, and layered semantics derived from linguistic and factual knowledge bases. The resulting graph is then fed back into the LLM to be extended with implicit knowledge activated by complex heuristic learning, including semantic implicatures, moral values, embodied cognition, and metaphorical representations. By bridging the gap between unstructured language models and formal semantic structures, our method opens new avenues for tackling intricate problems in natural language understanding and reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Neural symbolic processing aims to combine the generalization of logical learning approaches and the performance of neural networks. The Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) model by Rocktaschel et al (2017) learns embeddings for concepts and performs logical unification. While NTP is promising and effective in predicting facts accurately, we have little knowledge how well it can extract true relationship among data. To this end, we create synthetic logical datasets with injected relationships, which can be generated on-the-fly, to test neural-based relation learning algorithms including NTP. We show that it has difficulty recovering relationships in all but the simplest settings. Critical analysis and diagnostic experiments suggest that the optimization algorithm suffers from poor local minima due to its greedy winner-takes-all strategy in identifying the most informative structure (proof path) to pursue. We alter the NTP algorithm to increase exploration, which sharply improves performance. We argue and demonstate that it is insightful to benchmark with synthetic data with ground-truth relationships, for both evaluating models and revealing algorithmic issues.",

    "abstract": "Providing personalized feedback in Intelligent Transport Systems is a powerful tool for instigating a change in driving behaviour and the reduction of CO2 emissions. This requires a system that is capable of detecting driver characteristics from real-time vehicle data. In this paper, we apply the architecture and theory of a Neural-Symbolic Cognitive Agent (NSCA) to effectively learn and reason about observed driving behaviour and related driver characteristics. The NSCA architecture combines neural learning and reasoning with symbolic temporal knowledge representation and is capable of encoding background knowledge, learning new hypotheses from observed data, and inferring new beliefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and errors in the data using a Bayesian inference model, and it scales well to hundreds of thousands of data samples as in the application reported in this paper. We have applied the NSCA in an Intelligent Transport System to reduce CO2 emissions as part of an European Union project, called EcoDriver. Results reported in this paper show that the NSCA outperforms the state-of-the-art in this application area, and is applicable to very large data.",

    "abstract": "CDK4/6 Inhibitors As part of the evolving scenario of the adjuvant setting of ER-positive HER2-negative early BC (EBC), cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), in conjunction with adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), have demonstrated significant improvements in clinical outcomes for patients at high risk of recurrence, as evidenced by the results of the monarchE [6,7] and NATALEE trials [8] for abemaciclib and ribociclib, respectively. Following this, the protocol-specified final iDFS analysis, which had a median follow-up of 33.3 months, indicated that 42.8% of patients completed three years of ribociclib treatment, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.749 (95% CI, 0.628-0.892; nominal one-sided p = 0.0006). Notably, in a four-year landmark analysis, the combination of ribociclib and NSAI continued to exhibit both iDFS and distant DFS (DDFS) benefits over NSAI alone, with a 28.5% reduction in the risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.715; 95% CI, 0.604-0.847). PARP Inhibitors The introduction of the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib in the adjuvant setting marks a paradigm shift for patients with germline BReast CAncer gene (BRCA)1 or BRCA2 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants.",

    "abstract": "Neural-symbolic AI (NeSy) allows neural networks to exploit symbolic background knowledge in the form of logic. It has been shown to aid learning in the limited data regime and to facilitate inference on out-of-distribution data. Probabilistic NeSy focuses on integrating neural networks with both logic and probability theory, which additionally allows learning under uncertainty. A major limitation of current probabilistic NeSy systems, such as DeepProbLog, is their restriction to finite probability distributions, i.e., discrete random variables. In contrast, deep probabilistic programming (DPP) excels in modelling and optimising continuous probability distributions. Hence, we introduce DeepSeaProbLog, a neural probabilistic logic programming language that incorporates DPP techniques into NeSy. Doing so results in the support of inference and learning of both discrete and continuous probability distributions under logical constraints. Our main contributions are 1) the semantics of DeepSeaProbLog and its corresponding inference algorithm, 2) a proven asymptotically unbiased learning algorithm, and 3) a series of experiments that illustrate the versatility of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet they struggle with inconsistent reasoning, particularly in novel domains and complex logical sequences. This research introduces Proof of Thought, a framework that enhances the reliability and transparency of LLM outputs. Our approach bridges LLM-generated ideas with formal logic verification, employing a custom interpreter to convert LLM outputs into First Order Logic constructs for theorem prover scrutiny. Central to our method is an intermediary JSON-based Domain-Specific Language, which by design balances precise logical structures with intuitive human concepts. This hybrid representation enables both rigorous validation and accessible human comprehension of LLM reasoning processes. Key contributions include a robust type system with sort management for enhanced logical integrity, explicit representation of rules for clear distinction between factual and inferential knowledge, and a flexible architecture that allows for easy extension to various domain-specific applications. We demonstrate Proof of Thought's effectiveness through benchmarking on StrategyQA and a novel multimodal reasoning task, showing improved performance in open-ended scenarios. By providing verifiable and interpretable results, our technique addresses critical needs for AI system accountability and sets a foundation for human-in-the-loop oversight in high-stakes domains.",

    "abstract": "Patients with neuropathic pain account for 30-50% of the patients referring to pain clinics. The treatment of neuropathic pain is a difficult clinical situation in which classical analgesics and treatment methods remain inadequate and which requires interdisciplinary treatment. Neuropathic pain is usually refractory to treatment and clinicians frequently use drug combinations and sometimes invasive interventions. The aim of the present study was to measure the efficacy of invasive and non-invasive methods in patients with neuropathic pain by comparing VAS scores at the baseline of treatment, at 1st month, 2nd months, and 6th months. A total of 127 patients older than 15 who were referred to the algology section of Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine Anesthesiology and Reanimation Department between 2005 and 2008 and who underwent treatment with invasive and non-invasive methods were included in the study. Group 1: Non-invasive group (n: 76) includes patients undergoing treatment with non-pharmacological methods such as exercise and psychotherapy and pharmacological methods such as tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, SSRI, topical and I.V. lidocain, opioids, canabinoids, NSAI, and NMDA receptor antagonists. Group 2: Invasive group (n: 51): includes patients who underwent treatment with epidural or perineural injections of local anesthetics and corticosteroids, implantation of epidural intrathecal drug administration systems, and neural ablative systems (glycerol injection to gasser ganglion or gamma knife treatment. In the distribution of VAS levels according to group during follow up period, there was no statistically significant difference between medical and invasive groups at any time interval (P>0.01), while significant intra-group differences were found in both groups at all time intervals from the baseline to 2nd year (P<0.01). In the medical treatment group, VAS levels decreased compared to baseline in all time intervals. There was significant difference between all time intervals (P<0.001). In invasive treatment group VAS levels decreased compared to baseline at all time intervals. In addition, there was significant difference between all time intervals (P<0.001). Results of the present study indicate that pharmacological options exerting analgesic effect on pain and invasive methods are essential in relieving in neuropathic pain and improving functionality and quality of life by themselves with proper indications or in combination.",

    "abstract": "Contrary to frequent views, all-or-none latches, computation in steps, and enabling of neural groups are plausible in biological brains (developed in deCallatay, 1992). Brains might have several components processing symbols and computing rhythmically. Neural networks with classifiers are mechanisms converting physical analog data into disc''te symbols. These NNs a'' called symbolic neural networks (SNNs) as their models use symbols. Reasoning in SNNs has several limitations for strict logic. These limitations might be advantages for solving problems, e.g., strict logic halts in the absence of secure knowledge while the model here makes decisions at best. Topics discussed are learning of invariant rules by experience, inference from examples and not from generalized rules, decision at best, combinatorial explosion, representation of variables, problem solving as in a subset of Prolog, parsing with enabled stacks, scheduling of movements, and episodic memory.",

    "year": "2024",
    "author": "Tilwani, Deepa and Venkataramanan, Revathy and Amit, P. Sheth",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Attribution in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant challenge, particularly in ensuring the factual accuracy and reliability of the generated outputs. Current methods for citation or attribution, such as those employed by tools like Perplexity.ai and Bing Search-integrated LLMs, attempt to ground responses by providing real-time search results and citations. However, so far, these approaches suffer from issues such as hallucinations, biases, surface-level relevance matching, and the complexity of managing vast, unfiltered knowledge sources. While tools like Perplexity.ai dynamically integrate web-based information and citations, they often rely on inconsistent sources such as blog posts or unreliable sources, which limits their overall reliability. We present that these challenges can be mitigated by integrating Neurosymbolic AI (NesyAI), which combines the strengths of neural networks with structured symbolic reasoning. NesyAI offers transparent, interpretable, and dynamic reasoning processes, addressing the limitations of current attribution methods by incorporating structured symbolic knowledge with flexible, neural-based learning. This paper explores how NesyAI frameworks can enhance existing attribution models, offering more reliable, interpretable, and adaptable systems for LLMs.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) scientists have been conducting investigations to attain human-level performance by a machine in accomplishing a cognitive task. Within machine learning, the ultimate aspiration is to attain Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through a machine. This pursuit has led to the exploration of two distinct AI paradigms. Symbolic AI, also known as classical or GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned AI) and Connectionist (Sub-symbolic) AI, represented by Neural Systems, are two mutually exclusive paradigms. Symbolic AI excels in reasoning, explainability, and knowledge representation but faces challenges in processing complex real-world data with noise. Conversely, deep learning (Black-Box systems) research breakthroughs in neural networks are notable, yet they lack reasoning and interpretability. Neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy), an emerging area of AI research, attempts to bridge this gap by integrating logical reasoning into neural networks, enabling them to learn and reason with symbolic representations. While a long path, this strategy has made significant progress towards achieving common sense reasoning by systems. This article conducts an extensive review of over 977 studies from prominent scientific databases (DBLP, ACL, IEEExplore, Scopus, PubMed, ICML, ICLR), thoroughly examining the multifaceted capabilities of Neuro-Symbolic AI, with a particular focus on its healthcare applications, particularly in drug discovery, and Protein engineering research. The survey addresses vital themes, including reasoning, explainability, integration strategies, 41 healthcare-related use cases, benchmarking, datasets, current approach limitations from both healthcare and broader perspectives, and proposed novel approaches for future experiments.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The antibacterial activity of the lactoperoxidase system on the growth and survival of Listeria monocytogenes in trypticase soy broth, UHT milk and French soft cheese was determined. Several levels of Listeria cells, ranging from ca. 10 to 10(4) or 10(7) CFU/ml were studied. A comparison was made between the behavior of L. monocytogenes in these media with or without the lactoperoxidase system at two storage temperatures, 4 and 15°C. In trypticase soy broth and UHT milk, presence of the lactoperoxidase system either inhibited growth or completely inactivated inoculated cells. Complete inactivation occurred at different times depending on initial inoculum concentration, culture medium, and storage temperature. In UHT milk, the D-values were determined from the regression lines of log cell populations versus time. The linear correlations are significant, and D-values were the same (ca. 5 d at 15°C and ca. 8 d at 4°C) whatever the initial cell level. The efficiency of the lactoperoxidase system is dependent on temperature, which directly determines the antibacterial activity. The addition of the lactoperoxidase system to the surface of soft cheese led to elimination of viable Listeria cells from cheeses previously inoculated to contain 10 to 10(6) CFU/g. The results of this study suggest that the lactoperoxidase system may be effective in dairy products as a safety factor to assist in the inhibition of L. monocytogenes .",

    "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, blending neural networks with symbolic AI, have facilitated transparent reasoning and context understanding without the need for explicit rule-based programming. However, implementing such models in the Internet of Things (IoT) sensor nodes presents hurdles due to computational constraints and intricacies. In this work, for the first time, we propose a near-sensor neuro-symbolic AI computing accelerator named Neuro-Photonix for vision applications. Neuro-photonix processes neural dynamic computations on analog data while inherently supporting granularity-controllable convolution operations through the efficient use of photonic devices. Additionally, the creation of an innovative, low-cost ADC that works seamlessly with photonic technology removes the necessity for costly ADCs. Moreover, Neuro-Photonix facilitates the generation of HyperDimensional (HD) vectors for HD-based symbolic AI computing. This approach allows the proposed design to substantially diminish the energy consumption and latency of conversion, transmission, and processing within the established cloud-centric architecture and recently designed accelerators. Our device-to-architecture results show that Neuro-Photonix achieves 30 GOPS/W and reduces power consumption by a factor of 20.8 and 4.1 on average on neural dynamics compared to ASIC baselines and photonic accelerators while preserving accuracy.",

    "author": "Dharani, Chandra",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning.",

We report one case of a 47-year-old man who presented with tumefaction of a leg with multiple skin fistulae. Histopathological examination permitted to confirm the diagnosis of actinomycetoma and TDM showed the degree of bone and soft tissues involvement. Our case was characterized by the very inflammatory aspect of the tumor, its localization to the leg without foot involvement, the modest functional signs compared to the importance of radiological bone involvements, the deep destruction of the fibula while the tibia was apparently intact and the good response to treatment. In spite of its characteristic features, diagnosis of mycetoma is still late in our country, often with bone and/or articular spread. Priority may be given to measures for reduction of mycetoma diagnosis lateness. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.",

    "abstract": "An emerging class of neurosymbolic methods relies on the use of neural networks to determine the parameters of symbolic probabilistic models. To train these hybrid models, these methods use a knowledge compiler to turn the symbolic model into a differentiable arithmetic circuit, after which gradient descent can be performed. However, these methods require compiling a reasonably sized circuit, which is not always possible, as for many symbolic probabilistic models calculating a gradient towards the parameters is #P-hard. We introduce a new approach for learning parameters using partially compiled circuits with approximation nodes. We show that, if the errors made in the approximation nodes are bounded, the error on the gradient of partially compiled circuits can also be bounded. We evaluate the impact of various approximation guarantees on this approach's learning and generalization performance. Using approximation allows more complex queries to be compiled and our experiments show that their addition helps reduce the training loss. However, we observe that there is a limit to the addition of partial circuits after which there is no more improvement.",

    "abstract": "Complexity of technology is constantly increasing; for the field of automation this means that economic considerations dictate a need for corresponding measures. Artificial intelligence boasts noteworthy successes in this area; however, its achievements appear modest when compared to the faculties of human intelligence. This paper will demonstrate that a new modeling approach is required via possibilities offered by the mindset and tools of computer technology, thereby demonstrating why a psychoanalytic approach seems sensible and necessary. The paramount goal of the research introduced in the following is a formal approach to describing the human psyche based on the neuro-symbolic and neuronal functional layers. Questions associated with this approach include: To what extent can the psychoanalytic model be confirmed by computer technology and the possibility of simulation? To what extent is an axiomatically developed terminology in psychoanalysis a prerequisite for the better integration of the natural-scientific way of thinking in psychoanalysis? The paper is based on the results of several fundamental research projects within the framework of ARS (Artificial Recognition System) which were funded in part nationally and in part by the EU.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) have become a quite popular class of models specifically devised to deal with ontologies and graph structure data, as they can implicitly encode statistical dependencies between entities and relations in a latent space. KGE techniques are particularly effective for the biomedical domain, where it is quite common to deal with large knowledge graphs underlying complex interactions between biological and chemical objects. Recently in the literature, the PharmKG dataset has been proposed as one of the most challenging knowledge graph biomedical benchmark, with hundreds of thousands of relational facts between genes, diseases and chemicals. Despite KGEs can scale to very large relational domains, they generally fail at representing more complex relational dependencies between facts, like logic rules, which may be fundamental in complex experimental settings. In this paper, we exploit logic rules to enhance the embedding representations of KGEs on the PharmKG dataset. To this end, we adopt Relational Reasoning Network (R2N), a recently proposed neural-symbolic approach showing promising results on knowledge graph completion tasks. An R2N uses the available logic rules to build a neural architecture that reasons over KGE latent representations. In the experiments, we show that our approach is able to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art on the PharmKG dataset. Finally, we provide an ablation study to experimentally compare the effect of alternative sets of rules according to different selection criteria and varying the number of considered rules.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a critical role in applications such as wildlife monitoring, disaster recovery, and precision agriculture, where continuous coverage and longevity are paramount amidst dynamic environmental challenges. To address these demands, the cellular adaptive energy forecasting and coverage optimization (CAEFCO) framework integrates localized neuro-symbolic energy forecasting (LNS-EF), a novel concept that combines symbolic reasoning with neural network learning directly on sensor nodes. LNS-EF enables nodes to not only predict energy depletion based on past consumption patterns and environmental factors but also incorporate rule-based contextual reasoning for enhanced decision-making. Alongside this, CAEFCO employs an anomaly detection module that identifies disruptions, such as sensor damage or environmental interference, allowing real-time task redistribution. This dual approach ensures seamless task reallocation while extending network lifetime. CAEFCO's proactive methodology demonstrates a 97% reduction in data loss and an 85% improvement in network longevity, offering a breakthrough in the resilience and sustainability of WSNs in mission-critical and harsh environments.",

    "abstract": "For text sentiment analysis, state-of-the-art neural language models have demonstrated promising performance. However, they lack interpretability, require vast volumes of annotated data, and are typically specialized for tasks. In this article, we explore a connection between fine-tuned Transformer models and unsupervised LDA approach to cope with text sentiment analysis tasks, inspired by the concept of Neuro-symbolic AI. The Transformer and LDA models are combined as a feature extractor to extract the hidden representations of the input text sequences. Subsequently, we employ a feedforward network to forecast various sentiment analysis tasks, such as multi-label emotion prediction, dialogue quality prediction, and nugget detection. Our proposed method obtains the best results in the NTCIR-16 dialogue evaluation (DialEval-2) task, as well as cutting-edge results in emotional intensity prediction using the Ren\\_{C}{E}{C}ps corpus. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method is highly explainable, cost-effective in training, and superior in terms of accuracy and robustness.",

'' This biennial 2022 edition is slightly different from the previous editions: We solicited submissions from individuals who had obtained their Ph.D. up to 10 years prior (as opposed to 5 years in all of the previous editions). This led to more applications of the highest quality. The selection committee finally had to select 10 outstanding contributors from a pool of 30+ highly competitive and strong nominations, which made the selection decisions rather difficult. After a careful and detailed selection process through many rounds of discussions via e-mails and live meetings, the committee voted unanimously on a short list of 10 top candidates who have all demonstrated outstanding achievements in different areas of AI. The selection was based solely on scientific quality, reputation, impact, and expert endorsements accumulated since their Ph.D. It is our honor and privilege to announce the following 2022 class of ``AI's 10 to Watch.

    "abstract": "Mefenamic acid is a fenamate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drug, which is used for several years for pain management. However, it has been rarely reported that, mefenamic acid can induce central nervous system toxicity both in toxic doses and therapeutic usage. We report a case of a 27-year-old female who presented to the emergency department (ED) with altered mental status and vomiting. On admission to the ED, she was lethargic and disoriented. Her vital signs were normal and her physical examination was completely normal except dysarthric speech. The etiology of altered mental status was investigated with electrolyte levels, cranial computed tomography, cranial magnetic resonance imaging and EEG, however the results were normal. Her blood gas analysis revealed a deep metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.14. Neither etiologic agent nor drug use history was provided at the presentation; she had only osteogenesis imperfecta since several years and she had been using various NSAI drugs. However, her relatives later stated that, she took mefenamic acid for her pains since two weeks. After her admission to intensive care unit, her neurologic state was improved gradually after plasmapheresis and she was discharged healthy. Although mefenamic acid has been considered as one of the safe NSAI drugs, its effects due to central nervous system toxicity should be cautiously handled.",

    "abstract": "Phase I pharmacokinetic (PK) study assessed circulating estrogens in breast cancer (BC) patients on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) with vaginal atrophy using vaginal ultra-low-dose 0.03 mg estriol (E3) and Lactobacillus combination vaginal tablets (Gynoflor(A (R))). 16 women on NSAI with severe vaginal atrophy applied a daily vaginal tablet of Gynoflor(A (R)) for 28 days followed by a maintenance therapy of 3 tablets weekly for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were serum concentrations and PK of E3, estradiol (E2), and estrone (E1) using highly sensitive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Secondary outcomes were clinical measures for efficacy and side effects; microscopic changes in vaginal epithelium and microflora; and changes in serum FSH, LH, and sex hormone-binding globulin. Compared with baseline, serum E1 and E2 did not increase in any of the women at any time following vaginal application. Serum E3 transiently increased after the first application in 15 of 16 women, with a maximum of 168 pg/ml 2-3 h post-insertion. After 4 weeks, serum E3 was slightly increased in 8 women with a maximum of 44 pg/ml. The vaginal atrophy resolved or improved in all women. The product was well tolerated, and discontinuation of therapy was not observed. The low-dose 0.03 mg E3 and Lactobacillus acidophilus vaginal tablets application in postmenopausal BC patients during AI treatment suffering from vaginal atrophy lead to small and transient increases in serum E3, but not E1 or E2, and therefore can be considered as safe and efficacious for treatment of atrophic vaginitis in BC patients taking NSAIs.",

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more integrated into our daily lives, it is crucial to identify and mitigate their risks, especially when the risks can have profound impacts on human users and societies. Guardrails, which filter the inputs or outputs of LLMs, have emerged as a core safeguarding technology. This position paper takes a deep look at current open-source solutions (Llama Guard, Nvidia NeMo, Guardrails AI), and discusses the challenges and the road towards building more complete solutions. Drawing on robust evidence from previous research, we advocate for a systematic approach to construct guardrails for LLMs, based on comprehensive consideration of diverse contexts across various LLMs applications. We propose employing socio-technical methods through collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team to pinpoint precise technical requirements, exploring advanced neural-symbolic implementations to embrace the complexity of the requirements, and developing verification and testing to ensure the utmost quality of the final product.",

    "abstract": "In the burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing a robust safety mechanism, colloquially known as \"safeguards\" or \"guardrails\", has become imperative to ensure the ethical use of LLMs within prescribed boundaries. This article provides a systematic literature review on the current status of this critical mechanism. It discusses its major challenges and how it can be enhanced into a comprehensive mechanism dealing with ethical issues in various contexts. First, the paper elucidates the current landscape of safeguarding mechanisms that major LLM service providers and the open-source community employ. This is followed by the techniques to evaluate, analyze, and enhance some (un)desirable properties that a guardrail might want to enforce, such as hallucinations, fairness, privacy, and so on. Based on them, we review techniques to circumvent these controls (i.e., attacks), to defend the attacks, and to reinforce the guardrails. While the techniques mentioned above represent the current status and the active research trends, we also discuss several challenges that cannot be easily dealt with by the methods and present our vision on how to implement a comprehensive guardrail through the full consideration of multi-disciplinary approach, neural-symbolic method, and systems development lifecycle.",

    "abstract": "Neural-symbolic learning, aiming to combine the perceiving power of neural perception and the reasoning power of symbolic logic together, has drawn increasing research attention. However, existing works simply cascade the two components together and optimize them isolatedly, failing to utilize the mutual enhancing information between them. To address this problem, we propose DeepLogic, a framework with joint learning of neural perception and logical reasoning, such that these two components are jointly optimized through mutual supervision signals. In particular, the proposed DeepLogic framework contains a deep-logic module that is capable of representing complex first-order-logic formulas in a tree structure with basic logic operators. We then theoretically quantify the mutual supervision signals and propose the deep&logic optimization algorithm for joint optimization. We further prove the convergence of DeepLogic and conduct extensive experiments on model performance, convergence, and generalization, as well as its extension to the continuous domain. The experimental results show that through jointly learning both perceptual ability and logic formulas in a weakly supervised manner, our proposed DeepLogic framework can significantly outperform DNN-based baselines by a great margin and beat other strong baselines without out-of-box tools.",

Eight hundred and forty-five consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding related to endoscopically proven peptic ulcer or gastroduodenal erosions were admitted between 1983 and June 1987 to an intensive care unit for digestive tract hemorrhage. Of these, 267 were using anti-inflammatory drugs: 151 (56 p. 100) were taking NSAI drugs other than salicylates, 97 salicylates (36 p. 100) and 10, steroids (4 p . 100). Patients taking nonsteroidal drugs without or with salicylates were compared with patients bleeding from gastroduodenal ulcer or erosion not receiving anti-inflammatory therapy. Patients receiving nonsteroidal drugs not containing salicylates were older (70 p. 100 over 65 years of age vs 46 p. 100, p < 0.001) and the proportion of female patients was greater (54 p, 100 vs 33 p, 100, p < 0.001) than in the other group. No significant difference was observed with regard to the following parameters: percentage of gastric lesions, concomitant anticoagulant therapy, need for surgical hemostasis, or mortality. Patients taking aspirin had more gastric lesions (75 p. 100 vs 64 p. 100, p < 0.05) and less need for surgical hemostatis (7 p. 100 vs 15 p. 100, p < 0.05); the other parameters did not differ. NSAI drugs other than salicylates were taken more often for osteoarthritis than salicylates (33.6 p. 100 vs 17.4 p. 100, p < 0.05). Duration of treatment was shorter in patients taking salicylates than in those taking NSAI drugs not containing salicylates (duration < 5 days for 65 p. 100 and 13.8 p. 100 respectively, p < 0.001). The proportion of individual NSAI drugs taken by the 151 patients hospitalized for upper gastroduodenal bleeding did not differ from that of the hospital area sales during the same period, except for pirprofen which was less frequently observed in the bleeders than could be expected from the selling frequency (0.7 p 100 vs. 12 p 100, p < 0.001). These data emphasize the high risk of upper gastroduodenal bleeding associated with anti-inflammatory therapy, especially with NSAI drugs not containing salicylates. Moreover this study suggests a different pattern of bleeding in patients taking salicylates, as compared with those taking NSAI drugs without salicylates, that should be taken into account by future investigators in epidemiologic or preventive therapy studies.",

With such methods, it has been possible to demonstrate the effect of NSAI vs placebo in hip arthritic patients. The study of the dynamic of the global center of gravity of patient during gait appears as a very good parameter. This measure is currently made using accelerometers.

A symbolic policy uncovers functional relations between the underlying states and action-probabilities. Further, the symbolic policy is utilized through importance sampling (IS) to improve the rewards received during the learning process. The effectiveness of S-REINFORCE has been validated on various dynamic decision-making problems involving low and high dimensional action spaces. The results obtained clearly demonstrate that by leveraging the complementary strengths of NN and SR, S-REINFORCE generates policies that exhibit both good performance and interpretability. This makes SREINFORCE an excellent choice for real-world applications where transparency and causality play a crucial role.",

    "abstract": "Identifying patient cohorts is fundamental to numerous healthcare tasks, including clinical trial recruitment and retrospective studies. Current cohort retrieval methods in healthcare organizations rely on automated queries of structured data combined with manual curation, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often yield low-quality results. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and information retrieval (IR) offer promising avenues to revolutionize these systems. Major challenges include managing extensive eligibility criteria and handling the longitudinal nature of unstructured Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) while ensuring that the solution remains cost-effective for real-world application. This paper introduces a new task, Automatic Cohort Retrieval (ACR), and evaluates the performance of LLMs and commercial, domain-specific neuro-symbolic approaches. We provide a benchmark task, a query dataset, an EMR dataset, and an evaluation framework. Our findings underscore the necessity for efficient, high-quality ACR systems capable of longitudinal reasoning across extensive patient databases.",

To make it possible to adapt such ANN for Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) for the household in which they are deployed is crucial but not easy to manage. The Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach in this paper makes it possible to do that by combining ANN modules with Probabilistic Logic which is used as a supervise process to check the outputs of the ANN in case of plausibility. This on the one hand filters implausible results out which is helpful for productive usage, on the other hand these post processed results can be used to retrain the network and adapt it for a specific household in a continual learning process.",

The proposed hybrid systems incorporate both the ability of deep neural networks to improve on their own through experience and the interpretability of the results provided by symbolic artificial intelligence approach. To justify the need for shifting towards hybrid systems, explanation, implementation, and comparison of the dense neural network and the neuro-symbolic network is performed in detail. For the comparison to be relevant, the same datasets were used in training and the metrics resulted have been compared. A review of the resulted metrics shows that while both methods have similar precision in their predictive models, with Logic Tensor Networks being also possible to have interactive accuracy and deductive reasoning over data.

    "year": "2024",
    "author": "Edwards, D. J.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "There have been impressive advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP) in recent years, largely driven by innovations in the development of transformer-based large language models (LLM) that utilize \"attention.\" This approach employs masked self-attention to establish (via similarly) different positions of tokens (words) within an inputted sequence of tokens to compute the most appropriate response based on its training corpus. However, there is speculation as to whether this approach alone can be scaled up to develop emergent artificial general intelligence (AGI), and whether it can address the alignment of AGI values with human values (called the alignment problem). Some researchers exploring the alignment problem highlight three aspects that AGI (or AI) requires to help resolve this problem: (1) an interpretable values specification; (2) a utility function; and (3) a dynamic contextual account of behavior. Here, a neurosymbolic model is proposed to help resolve these issues of human value alignment in AI, which expands on the transformer-based model for NLP to incorporate symbolic reasoning that may allow AGI to incorporate perspective-taking reasoning (i.e., resolving the need for a dynamic contextual account of behavior through deictics) as defined by a multilevel evolutionary and neurobiological framework into a functional contextual post-Skinnerian model of human language called \"Neurobiological and Natural Selection Relational Frame Theory\" (N-Frame). It is argued that this approach may also help establish a comprehensible value scheme, a utility function by expanding the expected utility equation of behavioral economics to consider functional contextualism, and even an observer (or witness) centric model for consciousness. Evolution theory, subjective quantum mechanics, and neuroscience are further aimed to help explain consciousness, and possible implementation within an LLM through correspondence to an interface as suggested by N-Frame. This argument is supported by the computational level of hypergraphs, relational density clusters, a conscious quantum level defined by QBism, and real-world applied level (human user feedback). It is argued that this approach could enable AI to achieve consciousness and develop deictic perspective-taking abilities, thereby attaining human-level self-awareness, empathy, and compassion toward others. Importantly, this consciousness hypothesis can be directly tested with a significance of approximately 5-sigma significance (with a 1 in 3.5 million probability that any identified AI-conscious observations in the form of a collapsed wave form are due to chance factors) through double-slit intent-type experimentation and visualization procedures for derived perspective-taking relational frames. Ultimately, this could provide a solution to the alignment problem and contribute to the emergence of a theory of mind (ToM) within AI.",

For the first time, we systematically apply it to multiple biomedical datasets and recommendation tasks with fair benchmark comparisons. The approach is found to outperform the best baselines by 21.7% on average whilst producing novel, biologically relevant explanations.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method to enable Large Language Models to access Knowledge Graph data and justify their text generation by showing the specific graph data the model accessed during inference. For this, we combine Language Models with methods from Neurosymbolic Artificial Intelligence designed to answer queries on Knowledge Graphs. This is done by modifying the model so that at different stages of inference it outputs an Existential Positive First-Order query, which is then processed by an additional query appendix. This, in turn, uses neural link predictors along with description aware embeddings to resolve these queries. After that, the queries are logged and used as an explanation of the inference process of the complete model. Lastly, we train the model using a Linear Temporal Logic constraint-based loss function to measure the consistency of the queries among each other and with the final model output.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Within 24 hours after a full-thickness burn injury, predictable alterations occur in the dermal vasculature. At the immediate site of injury, vessels lose patency. In the periphery, vasodilation and increased permeability become widespread. A variety of interventions were employed to prevent these vascular sequelae. While systemic treatment, immediately after burn trauma, with hydrocortisone or the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compound indomethacin, was ineffective in preventing vascular alteration, treatments with other NSAI agents such as ibuprofen and imidazole were effective in preventing microvascular occlusion. In addition, utilizing standard radioimmunoassay techniques, the concentrations of the metabolites of two potent eicosanoids, thromboxane and prostacyclin, were measured from fluid collected in the implanted wound chambers. Following full-thickness burns, the synthesis and release of thromboxane were inhibited by indomethacin, imidazole, and ibuprofen. Furthermore, indomethacin and ibuprofen, but not imidazole, blocked the synthesis and release of prostacyclin into wound fluid. Significantly, ibuprofen was effective in preserving the dermal vasculature, even when administration was delayed as long as 6 hours after burn trauma. Pharmacologic actions not associated with the production of thromboxane or prostacyclin appear responsible for the protective effects of ibuprofen during burn injury. Such findings do not support an important role for either thromboxane or prostacyclin in the development of vascular alterations following burn injury.",

    "year": "2024",
    "author": "Eiter, Thomas and Markus, Hecher and Rafael, Kiesel",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "In the last decade, there has been increasing interest in extensions of answer set programming (ASP) that cater for quantitative information such as weights or probabilities. A wide range of quantitative reasoning tasks for ASP and logic programming, among them probabilistic inference and parameter learning in the neuro-symbolic setting, can be expressed as algebraic answer set counting (AASC) tasks, i.e., weighted model counting for ASP with weights calculated over some semiring, which makes efficient solvers for AASC desirable. In this article, we present aspmc , a new solver for AASC that pushes the limits of efficient solvability. Notably, aspmc provides improved performance compared to the state of the art in probabilistic inference by exploiting three insights gained from thorough theoretical investigations in our work. Namely, we consider the knowledge compilation step in the AASC pipeline, where the underlying logical theory specified by the answer set program is converted into a tractable circuit representation, on which AASC is feasible in polynomial time. First, we provide a detailed comparison of different approaches to knowledge compilation for programs, revealing that translation to propositional formulas followed by compilation to sd-DNNF seems favorable. Second, we study how the translation to propositional formulas should proceed to result in efficient compilation. This leads to the second and third insight, namely a novel way of breaking the positive cyclic dependencies in a program, called T n -Unfolding, and an improvement to the Clark Completion, the procedure used to transform programs without positive cyclic dependencies into propositional formulas. Both improvements are tailored towards efficient knowledge compilation. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while all three advancements contribute to the success of aspmc , T n -Unfolding improves performance significantly by allowing us to handle cyclic instances better.",

    "abstract": "Multi-hop query answering on knowledge graphs is known to be a challenging computational task. Neurosymbolic approaches using neural link predictors have shown promising results but are still outperformed by combinatorial optimization methods on several benchmarks, including the FB15k dataset. We analyze the task on the FB15k dataset and propose two new gradient-based methods, one learning simultaneously the representations of several candidate answers and the other learning a skolem function projecting to candidate answers instead of learning direct candidate representations. We implement both using Logic Tensor Networks. As part of this investigation we identified two important factors that limit the ability of differentiable methods to learn correct answers. The first factor is the (un)reliability of the pre-trained neural link predictors which biases the guesses of the query solver. To account for this, we suggest new evaluation metrics using satisfiability scores, that better reflect the true performance of neurosymbolic approaches on multi-hop query answering. The second factor is the regularization technique proposed in previous works, which limits the exploration of the gradient-based solver. Our results provide the foundation for future work mitigating these bottlenecks.",

Applications to machine learning have been pursued recently, and yet there is still a gap between abstract mathematical foundations and concrete applications to machine learning tasks. In this paper we introduce DisCoPyro as a categorical structure learning framework, which combines categorical structures (such as symmetric monoidal categories and operads) with amortized variational inference, and can be applied, e.g., in program learning for variational autoencoders. We provide both mathematical foundations and concrete applications together with comparison of experimental performance with other models (e.g., neuro-symbolic models).

This setup offers clear advantages in terms of consistency to symbolic prior knowledge, and is often believed to provide interpretability benefits in that - by virtue of complying with the knowledge - the learned concepts can be better understood by human stakeholders. However, it was recently shown that this setup is affected by reasoning shortcuts whereby predictions attain high accuracy by leveraging concepts with unintended semantics, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance and compromising interpretability. In this short paper, we establish a formal link between reasoning shortcuts and the optima of the loss function, and identify situations in which reasoning shortcuts can arise.

In this study, we perform a Bayesian analysis of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning objectives and propose a unified formulation based on likelihood learning. Our analysis suggests a simple method for integrating self-supervised learning with generative models, allowing for the joint training of these two seemingly distinct approaches. We refer to this combined framework as GEDI, which stands for GEnerative and DIscriminative training. Additionally, we demonstrate an instantiation of the GEDI framework by integrating an energy-based model with a cluster-based self-supervised learning model. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, we show that GEDI outperforms existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that GEDI can be integrated into a neural-symbolic framework to address tasks in the small data regime, where it can use logical constraints to further improve clustering and classification performance.",

This framework leverages the benefits of both GEnerative and DIscriminative approaches, resulting in improved symbolic representations over standalone solutions. Additionally, GEDI can be easily integrated and trained jointly with existing neuro-symbolic frameworks without the need for additional supervision or costly pre-training steps. We demonstrate through experiments on real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, that GEDI outperforms existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering performance by a significant margin. The symbolic component further allows it to leverage knowledge in the form of logical constraints to improve performance in the small data regime.",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning excels at learning representations from large amounts of data. At the same time, generative models offer the complementary property of learning information about the underlying data generation process. In this study, we aim at establishing a principled connection between these two paradigms and highlight the benefits of their complementarity. In particular, we perform an analysis of self-supervised learning objectives, elucidating the underlying probabilistic graphical models and presenting a standardized methodology for their derivation from first principles. The analysis suggests a natural means of integrating self-supervised learning with likelihood-based generative models. We instantiate this concept within the realm of cluster-based self-supervised learning and energy models, introducing a lower bound proven to reliably penalize the most important failure modes. Our theoretical findings are substantiated through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, demonstrating that our objective function allows to jointly train a backbone network in a discriminative and generative fashion, consequently outperforming existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering, generation and out-of-distribution detection performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that the solution can be integrated into a neuro-symbolic framework to tackle a simple yet non-trivial instantiation of the symbol grounding problem.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art neurosymbolic learning systems use probabilistic reasoning to guide neural networks towards predictions that conform to logical constraints over symbols. Many such systems assume that the probabilities of the considered symbols are conditionally independent given the input to simplify learning and reasoning. We study and criticise this assumption, highlighting how it can hinder optimisation and prevent uncertainty quantification. We prove that loss functions bias conditionally independent neural networks to become overconfident in their predictions. As a result, they are unable to represent uncertainty over multiple valid options. Furthermore, we prove that these loss functions are difficult to optimise: they are non-convex, and their minima are usually highly disconnected. Our theoretical analysis gives the foundation for replacing the conditional independence assumption and designing more expressive neurosymbolic probabilistic models.",

We propose a unified language for NeSy, which we call ULLER, a Unified Language for LEarning and Reasoning. ULLER encompasses a wide variety of settings, while ensuring that knowledge described in it can be used in existing NeSy systems. ULLER has a neuro-symbolic first-order syntax for which we provide example semantics including classical, fuzzy, and probabilistic logics. We believe ULLER is a first step towards making NeSy research more accessible and comparable, paving the way for libraries that streamline training and evaluation across a multitude of semantics, knowledge bases, and NeSy systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen the proposal of a number of neural architectures for the problem of Program Induction. Given a set of input-output examples, these architectures are able to learn mappings that generalize to new test inputs. While achieving impressive results, these approaches have a number of important limitations: (a) they are computationally expensive and hard to train, (b) a model has to be trained for each task (program) separately, and (c) it is hard to interpret or verify the correctness of the learnt mapping (as it is defined by a neural network). In this paper, we propose a novel technique, Neuro-Symbolic Program Synthesis, to overcome the above-mentioned problems. Once trained, our approach can automatically construct computer programs in a domain-specific language that are consistent with a set of input-output examples provided at test time. Our method is based on two novel neural modules. The first module, called the cross correlation I/O network, given a set of input-output examples, produces a continuous representation of the set of I/O examples. The second module, the Recursive-Reverse-Recursive Neural Network (R3NN), given the continuous representation of the examples, synthesizes a program by incrementally expanding partial programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the rich and complex domain of regular expression based string transformations. Experiments show that the R3NN model is not only able to construct programs from new input-output examples, but it is also able to construct new programs for tasks that it had never observed before during training.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning is an appropriate and successful method to robustly perform low-level robot control under noisy conditions. Symbolic action planning is useful to resolve causal dependencies and to break a causally complex problem down into a sequence of simpler high-level actions. A problem with the integration of both approaches is that action planning is based on discrete high-level action- and state spaces, whereas reinforcement learning is usually driven by a continuous reward function. However, recent advances in reinforcement learning, specifically, universal value function approximators and hindsight experience replay, have focused on goal-independent methods based on sparse rewards. In this article, we build on these novel methods to facilitate the integration of action planning with reinforcement learning by exploiting the reward-sparsity as a bridge between the high-level and low-level state- and control spaces. As a result, we demonstrate that the integrated neuro-symbolic method is able to solve object manipulation problems that involve tool use and non-trivial causal dependencies under noisy conditions, exploiting both data and knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Reovirus type 3 binds to approximately 20% of murine and human T cells via the viral hemagglutinin, a small outer capsid polypeptide. By using purified viral particles as a ligand in a standard plate separation technique, we have been able to enrich human peripheral blood and murine splenic T cells for reovirus receptor-positive cells (reovirus 3+) to levels of 88 to 92%. Analysis of reovirus 3+ T cells with monoclonal antibodies that identify inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic cells demonstrated that in the mouse, 68% of reovirus 3+ cells were Lyt-2+, and in the human, 60% were T8+. In reciprocal experiments, when subpopulations of murine and human T cells were prepared with the use of monoclonal anti-T cell reagents, 16% of Lyt-1+ and 81% of Lyt-2+ cells bound reovirus, whereas 30% of T4+ and 65% of T8+ cells bound reovirus. To determine whether reovirus type 3 identified a functional as well as a phenotypic category of cells, an antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell assay was employed. There was complete loss of cytotoxic activity in the reovirus 3+ cell population and slight enhancement of cytotoxic activity in the cell population from which reovirus 3+ cells were removed. This suggested that reovirus was binding to functionally active suppressor cells. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of antigen-specific T cells that were enriched for reovirus 3+ cells demonstrated suppression of cytoxic T cell activity. These results suggest that reovirus type 3 may identify a structure common to a subclass of murine and human T cells and that by using the virus as a natural biologic probe for cell surface receptors, one may be able to functionally segregate murine cytotoxic from suppressor T cells.",

Golimumab, an anti-TNF drug, have been available and get indication for AS patients in our country since January 2013. This study aimed to present the data on the efficacy of golimumab in patients with AS in a single center. Methods: Golimumab has been get indication in AS patients since January 2013 in our country. This study was conducted in May, 2014. In this study, 105 AS patients according to the New-York criteria and taking golimumab therapy were examined. Patients were divided into two groups such as; anti-TNF naive and before anti-TNF user. Demographic and clinical features of patients were recorded. DMARD usages before and after golimumab therapy were recorded. Before golimumab therapy; the acute phase responses were noted, BASDAI, BASFI, ASDAS-CRP, ASDAS-ESR scores were calculated. After golimumab therapy at month 3. BASDAI and 50% BASDAI response and at month 6. ASDAS-CRP response were recorded. Results: One hundred five AS patients were enrolled in this study. 60% of patients were male, mean age was 37.0 (8.8) years, mean duration of symptoms was 7.6 (6.3) years and mean duration of diagnosis was 5.5 (5.5) years. Of patients 55.5% (20/36) had HLA-B27 positivity, 6.5% had uveitis and 28.5% had positive family history. Before golimumab therapy 60% (63) of patients had been used DMARD and / or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 40% (42) of patients had been on anti-TNF drugs. In our patients with 6 months median follow-up period; at 3. month BASDAI 50% response in anti-TNF naive and before anti-TNF users were 48.5% and 35.0%, respectively. ASDAS-CRP clinically significany improvement rates at 6. month in anti-TNF naive and before anti-TNF users were 54.3% and 35.1%, respectively. After median follow-up 6 months; %80 of patients were continued golimumab therapy. Conclusion: In our study, golimumab was shown to be effective in about half of AS. Although golimumab is more effective in anti-TNF naive patients, but effectivity is obtained in before anti-TNF users also.Alternate abstract: Amaç: Ankilozan spondilit (AS) hastalarında anti-TNF tedavilerin etkili olduğu bilinmektedir. Golimumab, Ocak 2013 tarihinden itibaren ülkemizde AS endikasyonunda kullanıma girmiş bir anti-TNF ilaçtır. Bu çalışmada tek merkezdeki AS hastalarında golimumab kullanımının etkinliğine dair verilerin sunulması amaçlanmıştır. Yöntem: Golimumab 2013 Ocak ayından itibaren ülkemizde AS tanısında kullanıma başlanmıştır. Bu inceleme Mayıs 2014 tarihinde yapıldı. Bu çalışmada New-York kriterlerine göre AS tanısı alan, golimumab kullanan 105 hasta incelendi. Hastalar DMARD dirençli ve anti-TNF sonrası olmak üzere iki gruba ayrıldı. Hastaların demografik ve klinik özellikleri kaydedildi. Hastaların golimumab öncesi ve golimumabla kombine DMARD (sulfasalazin ve metotreksat) kullanımları kaydedildi. Golimumab öncesi hastalık aktivite ölçütleri olarak akut faz yanıtları, BASDAI, BASFI ve ASDAS-CRP, ASDAS-ESH skorları hesaplanmıştır. Tedavi sonrası 3. ayda BASDAI sonuçları, BASDAI %50 cevabı ve 6. ayda ASDAS-CRP cevapları hesaplanmıştır. Bulgular: Yüz beş AS hastası bu çalışmada değerlendirilmiştir. Hastaların %60'ı erkek, ortalama yaşı 37.0 (8.8), ortalama semptom süresi 7.6 (6.3) yıl, ortalama tanı süresi 5.5 (5.5) yıldır. HLA-B27 pozitifliği 20/36 (%55.5), üveit %6.5, pozitif aile öyküsü %28.5 hastada vardı. Golimumab öncesi 63 (%60) hastada DMARD ve/veya NSAİ ilaç, 42'sinde (%40) anti-TNF ilaç kullanılmıştır. Ortanca 6 ay takip süresi bulunan hastalarımızda 3. ayda BASDAI %50 cevabı anti-TNF naive hastalarda %48.5, daha önce anti-TNF kullanan hastalarda %35.0 olarak saptanmıştır. ASDAS-CRP klinik anlamlı düzelme oranları 6. ay sonunda anti-TNF naive grupta ve daha önce anti-TNF kullanan grupta sırasıyla %54.3 ve %35.1 olarak hesaplandı. Ortanca 6 aylık takip sonrasında hastalarımızın yaklaşık %80'inin golimumabı devam ettirmekte olduğu görüldü. Sonuç: HÜR-BİO veri tabanının sonuçlarına göre, AS hastalarında golimumabın ülkemiz hastalarının yaklaşık yarısında etkili olduğu bu çalışmada gösterilmiştir. DMARD/NSAİ dirençli hasta gruplarında golimumab daha etkili olmakla birlikte, anti-TNF sonrasında da etkinlik elde edilmektedir.",

However, as AI advances rapidly, most software vendors are unable to evaluate and implement all new developments. This paper uses bibliometric methods to track and evaluate the emerging trend of neurosymbolic AI, which combines neural networks with symbolic AI to improve decision making. By analyzing literature and citation data, we gain insights into the development and impact of neurosymbolic AI.

    "abstract": "Serum TSH was measured using a high sensitivity immunochemiluminometric assay (ICMA) in patients receiving anticonvulsant drugs, heparin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIs) and the results compared with those from groups of age- and sex-matched controls. The TSH results have also been compared with those of estimates of free thyroid hormone levels using Amerlex analogue method reagents. All patients were clinically euthyroid and TSH concentrations were in the normal, euthyroid range and did not differ significantly in any group studied. In contrast, Amerlex free T4 levels were significantly reduced in the patients treated with phenytoin (P < 0.001), carbamazepine (P < 0.01), sodium valproate (P < 0.01) and heparin (P < 0.001). Patients treated with NSAI agents showed no significant change in free T4 levels. Amerlex free T3 levels was also significantly reduced in the patients treated with phenytoin (P < 0.005), carbamazepine (P < 0.005) and heparin (P < 0.001) but not in those treated with sodium valproate or NSAIs. These data support the view that measurement of circulating TSH with an assay of sufficient precision in the relevant range provides a reliable way of assessing thyroid status and could be used to exclude hyperthyroidism in patients taking the medications investigated in this study.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Interest in logics with some notion of real-valued truths has existed since at least Boole and has been increasing in AI due to the emergence of neuro-symbolic approaches, though often their logical inference capabilities are characterized only qualitatively. We provide foundations for establishing the correctness and power of such systems. We introduce a rich class of multidimensional sentences, with a sound and complete axiomatization that can be parameterized to cover many real-valued logics, including all the common fuzzy logics, and extend these to weighted versions, and to the case where the truth values are probabilities. Our multidimensional sentences form a very rich class. Each of our multidimensional sentences describes a set of possible truth values for a collection of formulas of the real-valued logic, including which combinations of truth values are possible. Our completeness result is strong, in the sense that it allows us to derive exactly what information can be inferred about the combinations of truth values of a collection of formulas given information about the combinations of truth values of a finite number of other collections of formulas. We give a decision procedure based on linear programming for deciding, for certain real-valued logics and under certain natural assumptions, whether a set of our sentences logically implies another of our sentences. The generality of this work, compared to many previous works on special cases, may provide insights for both existing and new real-valued logics whose inference properties have never been characterized. This work may also provide insights into the reasoning capabilities of deep learning models.",

    "abstract": "The probability of viewing sunlit leaves (PT) is a crucial variable influencing observed canopy spectra. Proper determination of PT is necessary for the quantitative retrieval of vegetation parameters using remote sensing. This article describes a spectral index for estimating PT from satellite-observed canopy spectra. For this purpose, we propose a normalized spectral angle index (NSAI) at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, based on the spectral shapes of leaf and soil background. The performance of NSAI in estimating PT was evaluated using one ground-based high-resolution imaging dataset, one synthetic satellite dataset, and one satellite-ground synchronous observation dataset. The results demonstrate that NSAI is more suitable for estimating PT from satellite data than five commonly used spectral indices, including enhanced vegetation index (EVI), normalized difference spectral index (NDSI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio (SR) index, and photochemical reflectance index (PRI). NSAI exhibits a significant linear correlation with PT. The empirical model for estimating PT based on NSAI has the best transferability from simulated to in situ satellite data. For the fine spectral-spatial resolution (Hyperion) data, the normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE) and adjusted R-2 of estimated PT were 14.9% and 0.744, respectively. For MODIS images, PT was estimated with satisfactory accuracy, with an nRMSE of 18.71% and an adjusted R-2 of 0.670. NSAI is potentially applicable to satellite images for direct estimation of PT to improve the inversion accuracy of vegetation parameters.",

In this study, we report health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data from NATALEE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive ribociclib plus NSAI or NSAI alone. Patient-reported outcome scores [European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality of life questionnaire global health status and physical, social, and emotional functioning domains; the supplementary European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer breast cancer-specific QOL questionnaire breast symptoms scale; health on a visual analog scale of the generic EuroQOL 5-level instrument; and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale] were assessed. The prespecified primary HRQOL endpoint was physical functioning. Mean scores and time-categorical and prespecified linear-time repeated-measure models were used to evaluate HRQOL changes during treatment. RESULTS: HRQOL was evaluated in all patients in the ribociclib plus NSAI (n = 2,549) and NSAI alone (n = 2,552) arms. Compliance was high in both arms (≈93%-97%). Mean scores did not differ meaningfully from baseline for any analyzed domain. Likewise, neither a meaningful change from baseline (in either treatment arm) nor a difference between arms was observed during treatment in the time-categorical, model-adjusted mean scores for any HRQOL domains-using published thresholds for interpreting longitudinal and between-group differences, with all values being within 0.5 SD of their baseline values. Linear-time regression analysis confirmed these findings. CONCLUSIONS: These analyses of NATALEE show that adding adjuvant ribociclib to an NSAI does not negatively affect HRQOL in patients with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer.",

Conceptually, we provide a distinct definition for natural language reasoning in NLP, based on both philosophy and NLP scenarios, discuss what types of tasks require reasoning, and introduce a taxonomy of reasoning. Practically, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on natural language reasoning in NLP, mainly covering classical logical reasoning, natural language inference, multi-hop question answering, and commonsense reasoning. The paper also identifies and views backward reasoning, a powerful paradigm for multi-step reasoning, and introduces defeasible reasoning as one of the most important future directions in natural language reasoning research. We focus on single-modality unstructured natural language text, excluding neuro-symbolic techniques and mathematical reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Introduction. Neuropathic pain (NP) often fails to respond to the commonly established analgesic treatment. This fact, together with the existence of side effects, has led to the need to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness of antiepileptic drugs, which, as in the case of oxcarbazepine (OXC), are a valid alternative. Aims. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of OXC in patients suffering from chronic NP. Patients and methods. We conducted a prospective, open study involving a series of 40 patients diagnosed with a long history; of NP, which was previously resistant to different kinds of treatment with anticonvulsants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs, opiates and adjuncts. Patients were treated with OXC and they were evaluated in both the basal (prior to treatment) and final visits (after treatment) by means of the visual analogue scale (VAS), SF-McGill questionnaire and the Lattinen test. The patient's general impression of the result was also obtained. The statistical analysis was performed by calculating the `effect size', by computing Cohen's d. Results. Treatment with OXC diminishes different symptomatic variations of this pain, but especially so in the case of lancinating discharges (d = 0.87, important effect) and burning pain (d = 0.60, moderate-important effect), although the allodynia (d = 0.48, moderate effect) also improved with treatment. In the opinion of the patients themselves, response to treatment was good or very good in 50% of cases. The chief side effects observed were dizziness, drowsiness and abdominal upsets. Conclusions. OXC can be seen as a therapeutic alternative to be taken very much into account in patients with NP having different aetiologies; it has a good benefit-risk ratio and is a form of treatment that is well accepted by patients.",

In this context, we introduce patient monitoring as a special case of Human Activity Recognition and derive concrete requirements for this application area. We then present a process architecture and discuss why NeSy-AI should be applied for patient monitoring. To further support our argumentation, we show how NeSy-AI can help to overcome certain technical challenges that arise from this application area.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have significant potential to enable effective, robust and automated image phenotyping including identification of subtle patterns. AI-based detection searches the image space to find the regions of interest based on patterns and features. There is a spectrum of tumor histologies from benign to malignant that can be identified by AI-based classification approaches using image features. The extraction of minable information from images gives way to the field of radiomics and can be explored via explicit (handcrafted/engineered) and deep radiomics frameworks. Radiomics analysis has the potential to be utilized as a noninvasive technique for the accurate characterization of tumors to improve diagnosis and treatment monitoring. This work reviews AI-based techniques, with a special focus on oncological PET and PET/CT imaging, for different detection, classification, and prediction/prognosis tasks. We also discuss needed efforts to enable the translation of AI techniques to routine clinical workflows, and potential improvements and complementary techniques such as the use of natural language processing on electronic health records and neuro-symbolic AI techniques.",

To evaluate how these patients were managed by the team, a series of indicators were used, such as the number of identified patients, the quality of the documentation, the types of complementary investigations, the referral of patients to the secondary level, and the adequacy of therapies. As conclusions, a significant volume of rheumatologic consultations and work disabilities was found, with a high use rate of radiological studies and a low use rate of laboratory investigations, the use of basically NSAI drugs in the therapy, and the need for a specifically oriented clinical record to be used in the diagnosis and follow up of these conditions.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatic diseases (RD) of the temporomandibular joints (TMJs) are increasingly frequent affections and unfortunately often confused with \"classic\" manducatory dysfunctions (disk dislocation, myofascial pain syndroms). Their diagnosis is mandatory, given the major subsequent craniofacial disorders, which may occur (mandibular condylar hypoplasia, facial hyperdivergence, remodelling of the condylar unit, ankylosis), although the clinical implementation remains unspecific. The delayed diagnosis may be explained by the embryologic, anatomical and physiological characteristics of this joint. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), scans and more recently cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) allow to diagnose its early signs (alteration of the disc-ligament complex, intra-articular effusion, osteochondral lesions). The treatment of TMJ rheumatic diseases (RD) is not consensual, and often includes a non surgical phase (hygiene and dietary rules, non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAI), occlusal splints, and/or a surgical phase for the advanced stages (joint washing, orthognathic surgery, or joint surgery), and non responding patients to the medical treatment of inflammatory rheumatism. Orthodontics will be useful to correct dento-alveolar compensations, while monitoring, however, the impact on joint function.",

The flow regime within the saturators was analysed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to determine if sufficient mixing takes place within the final saturator. This was later investigated by experiment and it was found that sufficient mixing takes place for flow rates up to 3 l min(?1) at standard flow conditions of 101?325 Pa and 293.15?K. The uncertainty due to non-ideal saturation at 90 & xfffd;C dp is discussed. This uncertainty was analysed with respect to the effect that the flow speed and latent heating in the saturators has on the saturation efficiency, separately. The uncertainty associated with saturation efficiency at 90 & xfffd;C dew point was estimated from the temperature gradients along the saturation path arising due to latent heating effects.

Sows and gilts were bred once per day via one of the following treatments (d 1/d 2): NS/NS, NS/AI, AI/AI, and NS/none. Gilts bred with NS/AI, AI/AI, and NS/NS had higher (P less than .05) farrowing rates than gilts bred with NS/none matings. Similarly, farrowing rates were higher (P less than .05) in NS/AI than in NS/NS gilts. Numbers of pigs born alive were greater (P less than .05) in NS/NS, NS/AI, and AI/AI than in NS/none gilts. In sows, a treatment x time interaction (P less than .01) was present for farrowing rate. In the AI/AI treatment, farrowing rate increased (P less than .01) from 70.0% (wk 1 through 3) to 88.5% (wk 4 through 10). Farrowing rates were 87.3, 93.2, and 76.0% in the NS/NS, NS/AI, and NS/none groups, respectively, and did not change (P = .72) over time. Sows bred via NS/NS and NS/AI had larger litters (P less than .05) than NS/none sows. In the present study, if four or more sows and gilts were bred, then AI required less (P less than .05) time per animal than NS. Furthermore, gilts required more (P less than .05) time for breeding than sows. Results from this study demonstrate that gilts and sows responded differently to combinations of NS and AI in terms of reproductive performance. In addition, differences in labor requirements per sow or gilt between NS and AI matings were dependent on parity and daily breeding demands.",

    "abstract": "The detection of semantic relationships between objects represented in an image is one of the fundamental challenges in image interpretation. Neural-Symbolic techniques, such as Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs), allow the combination of semantic knowledge representation and reasoning with the ability to efficiently learn from examples typical of neural networks. We here propose Faster-LTN, an object detector composed of a convolutional backbone and an LTN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine both frameworks in an end-to-end training setting. This architecture is trained by optimizing a grounded theory which combines labelled examples with prior knowledge, in the form of logical axioms. Experimental comparisons show competitive performance with respect to the traditional Faster R-CNN architecture.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in embodied AI, agent reasoning systems still struggle to capture the fundamental conceptual structures that humans naturally use to understand and interact with their environment. To address this, we propose a novel framework that bridges embodied cognition theory and agent systems by leveraging a formal characterization of image schemas, which are defined as recurring patterns of sensorimotor experience that structure human cognition. By customizing LLMs to translate natural language descriptions into formal representations based on these sensorimotor patterns, we will be able to create a neurosymbolic system that grounds the agent's understanding in fundamental conceptual structures. We argue that such an approach enhances both efficiency and interpretability while enabling more intuitive human-agent interactions through shared embodied understanding.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models contributed to reaching unprecedented results in prediction and classification tasks of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. However, alongside this notable progress, they do not provide human-understandable insights on how a specific result was achieved. In contexts where the impact of AI on human life is relevant (e.g., recruitment tools, medical diagnoses, etc.), explainability is not only a desirable property, but it is -or, in some cases, it will be soon-a legal requirement. Most of the available approaches to implement eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focus on technical solutions usable only by experts able to manipulate the recursive mathematical functions in deep learning algorithms. A complementary approach is represented by symbolic AI, where symbols are elements of a lingua franca between humans and deep learning. In this context, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and their underlying semantic technologies are the modern implementation of symbolic AI-while being less flexible and robust to noise compared to deep learning models, KGs are natively developed to be explainable. In this paper, we review the main XAI approaches existing in the literature, underlying their strengths and limitations, and we propose neural-symbolic integration as a cornerstone to design an AI which is closer to non-insiders comprehension. Within such a general direction, we identify three specific challenges for future research-knowledge matching, cross-disciplinary explanations and interactive explanations.",

    "abstract": "Integrating symbolic knowledge and data-driven learning algorithms is a longstanding challenge in Artificial Intelligence. Despite the recognized importance of this task, a notable gap exists due to the discreteness of symbolic representations and the continuous nature of machine-learning computations. One of the desired bridges between these two worlds would be to define semantically grounded vector representation (feature embedding) of logic formulae, thus enabling to perform continuous learning and optimization in the semantic space of formulae. We tackle this goal for knowledge expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and devise a method to compute continuous embeddings of formulae with several desirable properties: the embedding (i) is finite-dimensional, (ii) faithfully reflects the semantics of the formulae, (iii) does not require any learning but instead is defined from basic principles, (iv) is interpretable. Another significant contribution lies in demonstrating the efficacy of the approach in two tasks: learning model checking, where we predict the probability of requirements being satisfied in stochastic processes; and integrating the embeddings into a neuro-symbolic framework, to constrain the output of a deep-learning generative model to comply to a given logical specification.",

    "abstract": "CYP450 aromatase catalyzes the terminal and rate-determining step in estrogen synthesis, the aromatization of androgens, and its inhibition is an efficient approach to treating estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Insight into the molecular basis of the interaction at the catalytic site between CYP450 aromatase inhibitors and the enzyme itself is required in order to design new and more active compounds. Hence, a combined molecular docking-molecular dynamics study was carried out to obtain the structure of the lowest energy association complexes of aromatase with some third-generation aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and with other novel synthesized letrozole-derived compounds which showed high in vitro activity. The results obtained clearly demonstrate the role of the pharmacophore groups present in the azaheterocyclic inhibitors (NSAIs)-namely the triazolic ring and highly functionalized aromatic moieties carrying H-bond donor or acceptor groups. In particular, it was pointed out that all of them can contribute to inhibition activity by interacting with residues of the catalytic cleft, but the amino acids involved are different for each compound, even if they belong to the same class. Furthermore, the azaheterocyclic group strongly coordinates with the Fe(II) of heme cysteinate in the most active NSAI complexes, while it prefers to adopt another orientation in less active ones.",

    "abstract": "Predictive Maintenance applications are increasingly complex, with interactions between many components. Black -box models are popular approaches based on deep -learning techniques due to their predictive accuracy. This paper proposes a neural -symbolic architecture that uses an online rule -learning algorithm to explain when the black -box model predicts failures. The proposed system solves two problems in parallel: (i) anomaly detection and (ii) explanation of the anomaly. For the first problem, we use an unsupervised state-of-the-art autoencoder. For the second problem, we train a rule learning system that learns a mapping from the input features to the autoencoder's reconstruction error. Both systems run online and in parallel. The autoencoder signals an alarm for the examples with a reconstruction error that exceeds a threshold. The causes of the signal alarm are hard for humans to understand because they result from a non-linear combination of sensor data. The rule that triggers that example describes the relationship between the input features and the autoencoder's reconstruction error. The rule explains the failure signal by indicating which sensors contribute to the alarm and allowing the identification of the component involved in the failure. The system can present global explanations for the black box model and local explanations for why the black box model predicts a failure. We evaluate the proposed system in a real -world case study of Metro do Porto and provide explanations that illustrate its benefits.",

    "abstract": "Logical reasoning is a major attribute of human intelligence. Humans demonstrate remarkable proficiency in combining information from multiple modalities for logical reasoning. This capability mirrors the tasks performed by Visual Question Answering (VQA), which is a complex task that requires an understanding of both visual elements and language. However, existing methods, which often rely on deep neural networks to learn implicit representations from data, lack the capacity to reason complex logical problems and provide interpretable explanations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that combines hybrid neural-symbolic reasoning and explainable AI to enhance the explicit reasoning capabilities of VQA models when addressing complex logic questions. Our approach comprises two main components: the Neural-Logical Reasoning Network (NLRN) with the Comprehensive Logical Composition Attention Mechanism (CLoCA), which trains and applies predefined logical rules within the neural network to effectively reason about complex logical questions in VQA tasks; and an explainable AI module that uses symbolic AI methods to provide explanations of the neural network's decision-making process in VQA. We evaluate our methodology on LoRA, a complex logical reasoning VQA dataset and other recent VQA datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable and accurate explanations.",

We introduce a novel differentiable inductive logic programming (ILP) model, called differentiable first-order rule learner (DFOL), which finds the correct LPs from relational facts by searching for the interpretable matrix representations of LPs. These interpretable matrices are deemed as trainable tensors in neural networks (NNs). The NNs are devised according to the differentiable semantics of LPs. Specifically, we first adopt a novel propositionalization method that transfers facts to NN-readable vector pairs representing interpretation pairs. We replace the immediate consequence operator with NN constraint functions consisting of algebraic operations and a sigmoid-like activation function. We map the symbolic forward-chained format of LPs into NN constraint functions consisting of operations between subsymbolic vector representations of atoms. By applying gradient descent, the trained well parameters of NNs can be decoded into precise symbolic LPs in forward-chained logic format. We demonstrate that DFOL can perform on several standard ILP datasets, knowledge bases, and probabilistic relation facts and outperform several well-known differentiable ILP models. Experimental results indicate that DFOL is a precise, robust, scalable, and computationally cheap differentiable ILP model.",

    "abstract": "Learning first -order logic programs from relational facts yields intuitive insights into the data. Inductive logic programming (ILP) models are effective in learning first -order logic programs from observed relational data. Symbolic ILP models support rule learning in a data -efficient manner. However, symbolic ILP models are not robust to learn from noisy data. Neuro-symbolic ILP models utilize neural networks to learn logic programs in a differentiable manner which improves the robustness of ILP models. However, most neuro-symbolic methods need a strong language bias to learn logic programs, which reduces the usability and flexibility of ILP models and limits the logic program formats. In addition, most neuro-symbolic ILP methods cannot learn logic programs effectively from both small -size datasets and large -size datasets such as knowledge graphs. In the paper, we introduce a novel differentiable ILP model called differentiable firstorder rule learner (DFORL), which is scalable to learn rules from both smaller and larger datasets. Besides, DFORL only needs the number of variables in the learned logic programs as input. Hence, DFORL is easy to use and does not need a strong language bias. We demonstrate that DFORL can perform well on several standard ILP datasets, knowledge graphs, and probabilistic relation facts and outperform several well-known differentiable ILP models. Experimental results indicate that DFORL is a precise, robust, scalable, and computationally cheap differentiable ILP model.",

    "abstract": "The combination of learning and reasoning is an essential and challenging topic in neuro-symbolic research. Differentiable inductive logic programming is a technique for learning a symbolic knowledge representation from either complete, mislabeled, or incomplete observed facts using neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable inductive logic programming system called differentiable learning from interpretation transition (D-LFIT) for learning logic programs through the proposed embeddings of logic programs, neural networks, optimization algorithms, and an adapted algebraic method to compute the logic program semantics. The proposed model has several characteristics, including a small number of parameters, the ability to generate logic programs in a curriculum-learning setting, and linear time complexity for the extraction of trained neural networks. The well-known bottom clause positionalization algorithm is incorporated when the proposed system learns from relational datasets. We compare our model with NN-LFIT, which extracts propositional logic rules from retuned connected networks, the highly accurate rule learner RIPPER, the purely symbolic LFIT system LF1T, and CILP++, which integrates neural networks and the propositionalization method to handle first-order logic knowledge. From the experimental results, we conclude that D-LFIT yields comparable accuracy with respect to the baselines when given complete, incomplete, and mislabeled data. Our experimental results indicate that D-LFIT not only learns symbolic logic programs quickly and precisely but also performs robustly when processing mislabeled and incomplete datasets.",

C-(ILP)-P-2 is a new massively parallel computational model based on a feedforward Artificial Neural Network that integrates inductive learning from examples and background knowledge, with deductive learning from Logic Programming. Starting with the background knowledge represented by a propositional logic program, a translation algorithm is applied generating a neural network that can be trained with examples. The results obtained with this refined network can be explained by extracting a revised logic program from it. Moreover, the neural network computes the stable model of the logic program inserted in it as background knowledge, or learned with the examples, thus functioning as a parallel system for Logic Programming. We have successfully applied C-(ILP)-P-2 to two real-world problems of computational biology, specifically DNA sequence analyses. Comparisons with the results obtained by some of the main neural, symbolic, and hybrid inductive learning systems, using the same domain knowledge, show the effectiveness of C-(ILP)-P-2.",

The goal of neural-symbolic integration is to benefit from the combination of features of the symbolic and connectionist paradigms of artificial intelligence. This paper introduces a new neural network architecture based on the idea of fibring logical systems. Fibring allows one to combine different logical systems in a principled way. Fibred neural networks may be composed not only of interconnected neurons but also of other networks, forming a recursive architecture. A fibring function then defines how this recursive architecture must behave by defining how the networks in the ensemble relate to each other, typically by allowing the activation of neurons in one network (A) to influence the change of weights in another network (B). Intuitively, this can be seen as training network B at the same time that one runs network A. We show that, in addition to being universal approximators like standard feedforward networks, fibred neural networks can approximate any polynomial function to any desired degree of accuracy, thus being more expressive than standard feedforward networks.",

    "abstract": "Modal logics are amongst the most successful applied logical systems. Neural networks were proved to be effective learning systems. In this paper, we propose to combine the strengths of modal logics and neural networks by introducing Connectionist Modal Logics (CML). CML belongs to the domain of neural-symbolic integration, which concerns the application of problem-specific symbolic knowledge within the neurocomputing paradigm. In CML, one may represent, reason or learn modal logics using a neural network. This is achieved by a Modalities Algorithm that translates modal logic programs into neural network ensembles. We show that the translation is sound, i.e. the network ensemble computes a fixed-point meaning of the original modal program, acting as a distributed computational model for modal logic. We also show that the fixed-point computation terminates whenever the modal program is well-behaved. Finally, we validate CML as a computational model for integrated knowledge representation and learning by applying it to a well-known testbed for distributed knowledge representation. This paves the way for a range of applications on integrated knowledge representation and learning, from practical reasoning to evolving multi-agent systems. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

    "abstract": "Introduction. It is reckoned that headaches affect, at least once a year, around 90% of the population. The socioeconomic repercussion occasioned by this malady justifies the appearance in recent years of headache units. Aim. To conduct a descriptive epidemiological and health care study of the activity carried out in a headache-specific clinic. Patients and methods. All the relevant points from the histories of patients who visited our surgery over a period of two years were collected prospectively and consecutively. The different types of headaches were classified according to the 1988 IHS criteria. Both the symptomatic and the preventive treatment were analysed. Results. In all, a total of 866 patients were found; 691 (79.8%) were females and the mean age was 39.8 +/- 15.9 years (range: 6-90 years); 208 (24%) had a history of migraine in the family; 399 (49.9%) were diagnosed as suffering from migraine: 256 (64.2%) had migraine without aura, 152 (19%) were diagnosed as having tension-type headache, and 218 (27.3%) presented chronic daily headache (CDH). The most frequently used symptomatic treatments were NSAI drugs (36.7%) and triptanes (28.4%). Amitriptyline (47.7%), beta-Mockers (14.5%) and calcium antagonists (11.3%) were the main drugs used as preventive treatment. Discussion. After several years' operation of our Headache Unit, we thought there was a need to analyse the population seen in the visits. The fact that the majority of our patients were middle-aged females matched our expectations. Although most of the patients were diagnosed as suffering from M we also want to highlight the high proportion of cases of CDH, above all associated with the abuse of analgesics.",

    "abstract": "Toxicity identification in online multimodal environments remains a challenging task due to the complexity of contextual connections across modalities (e.g., textual and visual). In this paper, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) from Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) and knowledge infusion to enhance the performance of toxicity detection in hateful memes. Our approach extracts sub-knowledge graphs from ConceptNet, a large-scale commonsense Knowledge Graph (KG) to be infused within a compact VLM framework. The relational context between toxic phrases in captions and memes, as well as visual concepts in memes enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Experimental results from our study on two hate speech benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance over the state-of-the-art baselines across AU-ROC, F1, and Recall with improvements of 1.1%, 7%, and 35%, respectively. Given the contextual complexity of the toxicity detection task, our approach showcases the significance of learning from both explicit (i.e. KG) as well as implicit (i.e. LVLMs) contextual cues incorporated through a hybrid neurosymbolic approach. This is crucial for real-world applications where accurate and scalable recognition of toxic content is critical for creating safer online environments.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This review summarises gastroduodenal protective mechanisms, the actions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) agents on mucus and HCO3 secretions, and the basis of gastric mucosal injury induced by acetylsalicylic and salicylic acids (ASA and SA). Resistance to autodigestion by acid and pepsin present in gastric juice is multifactorial involving pre-epithelial (mucus-bicarbonate barrier) and post-epithelial (blood flow, acid-base balance) factors in addition to properties of the surface cell layer per se. The latter includes mucosal re-epithelialisation, a property which appears particularly important with respect to recovery from acute injury. A range of NSAI agents (ASA, fenclofenac, ibuprofen and indomethacin) inhibit gastric HCO3 transport in isolated mucosal preparations. Inhibition of duodenal HCO3 transport has been demonstrated in response to indomethacin in vitro and in vivo. These effects on secretion can be antagonised by exogenous prostaglandins of the E series. The layer of secreted mucus gel overlying the epithelial surface is not affected by NSAI drugs in the short term. However a number of these agents have been shown to inhibit glycoprotein biosynthesis by the epithelial cells. Thus loss of this protective coat could be anticipated during chronic drug exposure since erosion of adherent mucus by luminal shear and proteolysis would not be compensated by continued secretion. Detailed analysis of the gastric mucosal injury induced by salicylates both in vitro and in vivo reveals that much of the damage previously attributed to ASA is in fact due to the metabolic product SA. In this respect it is concluded that mucosal injury caused by ASA is due to a combination of two factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "abstract": "Explainability and Safety engender Trust. These require a model to exhibit consistency and reliability. To achieve these, it is necessary to use and analyze data and knowledge with statistical and symbolic AI methods relevant to the AI application - neither alone will do. Consequently, we argue and seek to demonstrate that the NeuroSymbolic AI approach is better suited for making AI a trusted AI system. We present the CREST framework that shows how Consistency, Reliability, user-level Explainability, and Safety are built on NeuroSymbolic methods that use data and knowledge to support requirements for critical applications such as health and well-being. This article focuses on Large Language Models (LLMs) as the chosen AI system within the CREST framework. LLMs have garnered substantial attention from researchers due to their versatility in handling a broad array of natural language processing (NLP) scenarios. For example, ChatGPT and Google's MedPaLM have emerged as highly promising platforms for providing information in general and health-related queries, respectively. Nevertheless, these models remain black boxes despite incorporating human feedback and instruction-guided tuning. For instance, ChatGPT can generate unsafe responses despite instituting safety guardrails. CREST presents a plausible approach harnessing procedural and graph-based knowledge within a NeuroSymbolic framework to shed light on the challenges associated with LLMs.",

    "abstract": "Aim. To estimate changes in the concentrations of adhesion molecules and vascular endothelial growth factor A after 30-day additional use of amtolmetin guacil (AMG) in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who were unresponsive to previous one-year treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Subjects and methods. 20 patients with active AS who had not reached a BASDAI score <4.0 at week 52 of NSAID therapy and 10 healthy individuals matched for cardiovascular risk factors were examined. After 52 weeks of NSAID therapy, AMG was administered orally at 1200 mg/day to patients with AS for 30 days. The concentrations of adhesion molecules (sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1) and VEGF-A were measured. BASDAI and ASDAS scores and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined in AS patients. The concentrations of adhesion molecules and VEGF-A were investigated in patients with AS at baseline, at 52 weeks after NSAID treatment start, and at 30 days following AMH initiation (at week 56) and in healthy individuals at baseline and at 30 days. Results. The concentration of sICAM-1 in patients with AS was 987.0 +/- 217.39, 938.98 +/- 293.31, and 364.25 +/- 363.3 ng/ml at weeks 0, 52, and 56, respectively; that in healthy individuals was 769.25 +/- 189.32 and 740.05 +/- 225.76 ng/ml at baseline and at 30 days, respectively. The differences from the baseline concentration were significant in patients with AS (p<0.05) and insignificant in healthy subjects (p >= 0.05); the differences between the concentrations in patients with AS and the controls were significant at baseline and at 52 weeks (p<0.05). The concentration of sVCAM-1 in patients with AS was 364.25 +/- 160.49, 325.34 +/- 245.1, and 319.1 +/- 248.73 ng/ml at weeks 0, 52 and 56, respectively; that in healthy individuals was 245.13 +/- 40.4 and 248.73 +/- 34.42 ng/ ml, respectively (p<0.05 vs baseline values and values in healthy subjects). The level of VEGF-A in AS patients was not different from that in healthy individuals, but decreased during treatment. Correlations were found between the concentration of adhesion molecules and the level of CRP (p<0.01). Conclusion. Elevated concentrations of adhesion molecules have been found in AS patients compared with healthy individuals. The study has demonstrated that AMG treatment is efficient in treating patients with AS. NSAID/AMG treatment is associated with lower concentrations of adhesion molecules. Decreased CRP levels serve as predictors for reduced concentration of adhesion molecules. The level of VEGF-A at baseline did not differ from that in healthy subjects, but was deCreased during treatment with NSAI Ds.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) possess vast semantic knowledge but often struggle with complex reasoning tasks, particularly in relational reasoning problems such as kinship or spatial reasoning. In this paper, we present Path-of-Thoughts (PoT), a novel framework designed to tackle relation reasoning by decomposing the task into three key stages: graph extraction, path identification, and reasoning. Unlike previous approaches, PoT efficiently extracts a task-agnostic graph that identifies crucial entities, relations, and attributes within the problem context. Subsequently, PoT identifies relevant reasoning chains within the graph corresponding to the posed question, facilitating inference of potential answers. Experimental evaluations on four benchmark datasets, demanding long reasoning chains, demonstrate that PoT surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin (maximum 21.3%) without necessitating fine-tuning or extensive LLM calls. Furthermore, as opposed to prior neuro-symbolic methods, PoT exhibits improved resilience against LLM errors by leveraging the compositional nature of graphs.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In recent years, the perceptual capabilities of robots have been significantly enhanced. However, the task execution of the robots still lacks adaptive capabilities in unstructured and dynamic environments. METHODS: In this paper, we propose an ontology based autonomous robot task processing framework (ARTProF), to improve the robot's adaptability within unstructured and dynamic environments. ARTProF unifies ontological knowledge representation, reasoning, and autonomous task planning and execution into a single framework. The interface between the knowledge base and neural network-based object detection is first introduced in ARTProF to improve the robot's perception capabilities. A knowledge-driven manipulation operator based on Robot Operating System (ROS) is then designed to facilitate the interaction between the knowledge base and the robot's primitive actions. Additionally, an operation similarity model is proposed to endow the robot with the ability to generalize to novel objects. Finally, a dynamic task planning algorithm, leveraging ontological knowledge, equips the robot with adaptability to execute tasks in unstructured and dynamic environments. RESULTS: Experimental results on real-world scenarios and simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed ARTProF framework. DISCUSSION: In future work, we will focus on refining the ARTProF framework by integrating neurosymbolic inference.",

    "abstract": "The notion of equality (identity) is simple and ubiquitous, making it a key case study for broader questions about the representations supporting abstract relational reasoning. Previous work suggested that neural networks were not suitable models of human relational reasoning because they could not represent mathematically identity, the most basic form of equality. We revisit this question. In our experiments, we assess out-of-sample generalization of equality using both arbitrary representations and representations that have been pretrained on separate tasks to imbue them with structure. We find neural networks are able to learn (1) basic equality (mathematical identity), (2) sequential equality problems (learning ABA-patterned sequences) with only positive training instances, and (3) a complex, hierarchical equality problem with only basic equality training instances (\"zero-shot'\" generalization). In the two latter cases, our models perform tasks proposed in previous work to demarcate human-unique symbolic abilities. These results suggest that essential aspects of symbolic reasoning can emerge from data-driven, non-symbolic learning processes.",

    "abstract": "Objective: Hypersensitivity reactions (HR) to paracetamol are reported less commonly compared to other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAI) drugs. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of HR to paracetamol and paracetamol-propyphenazone combination (P-P) drugs in patients with analgesic intolerance and to assess the possible relations between HR to these drugs and other NSAI drugs as well as atopic diseases. Materials and Methods: A total of 262 patients with history of HR to analgesics within the past year were studied. Detailed history of atopy was taken and reported reactions were classified. Skin prick and intradermal tests were applied to the patients with P-P drug sensitivity. Single-blinded oral provocation tests with paracetamol were carried out in patients with negative skin test results. Results: HR to aspirin were high in men and patients with asthma [ p=0.03; OR=1.86 (95% CI 1.033.33), (p=0.03; OR=3.21 (95% CI 1.08-9.53), respectively]. The frequency of HR to paracetamol and P-P drugs was 12.7% and 10.8% respectively and the most commonly reported reaction was urticaria- angioedema. Skin tests were negative in 29 out of 30 subjects. All were found to be tolerant to paracetamol in challenge test. Frequency of self-reported HR to aspirin, metamizol and other NSAI drugs were high in patients reporting HR to paracetamol and P-P drugs (p< 0.001). Conclusion: In conclusion, hypersensitivity to aspirin and NSAI drugs need to be searched in patients with hypersensitivity to paracetamol. Paracetamol may be given as an alternative drug to the patients reporting HR to P-P drugs after negative skin testing and challenging.",

Concretely, in our study, the programming language is C, the specification language is ACSL, and the LLM is Deepseek-R1. In this context, we address two research directions, namely the specification of intent vs. implementation on the one hand, and the combination of symbolic analyses with LLMs on the other hand. For the first, we investigate how the absence or presence of bugs in the code impacts the generated specifications, as well as whether and how a user can direct the LLM to specify intent or implementation, respectively. For the second, we investigate the impact of results from symbolic analyses on the specifications generated by the LLM. The LLM prompts are augmented with outputs from two formal methods tools in the Frama-C ecosystem, Pathcrawler and EVA. We demonstrate how the addition of symbolic analysis to the workflow impacts the quality of annotations.",

Our review, which included the analysis of 128 studies, allowed us to identify three main categories of hybridization between machine learning and ontologies: learning-enhanced ontologies, semantic data mining, and learning and reasoning systems. We provide a comprehensive examination of all these categories, emphasizing the various machine learning algorithms utilized in the studies.

    "abstract": "This work presents a first evaluation of two state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek R1, on analogical reasoning, focusing on well-established nonverbal human IQ tests based on Raven's progressive matrices. We benchmark with the I-RAVEN dataset and its more difficult extension, I-RAVEN-X, which tests the ability to generalize to longer reasoning rules and ranges of the attribute values. To assess the influence of visual uncertainties on these nonverbal analogical reasoning tests, we extend the I-RAVEN-X dataset, which otherwise assumes an oracle perception. We adopt a two-fold strategy to simulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce confounding attributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the prediction of the correct answer of the puzzles and 2) smoothen the distributions of the input attributes' values. We observe a sharp decline in OpenAI's o3-mini task accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to just 17.0% - approaching random chance - on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X, which increases input length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty. This drop occurred despite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens. A similar trend is also observed for DeepSeek R1: from 80.6% to 23.2%. On the other hand, a neuro-symbolic probabilistic abductive model, ARLC, that achieves state-of-the-art performances on I-RAVEN, can robustly reason under all these out-of-distribution tests, maintaining strong accuracy with only a modest reduction from 98.6% to 88.0%.

    "abstract": "This survey explores the integration of learning and reasoning in two different fields of artificial intelligence: neurosymbolic and statistical relational artificial intelligence. Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NeSy) studies the integration of symbolic reasoning and neural networks, while statistical relational artificial intelligence (StarAI) focuses on integrating logic with probabilistic graphical models. This survey identifies seven shared dimensions between these two subfields of AI. These dimensions can be used to characterize different NeSy and StarAI systems. They are concerned with (1) the approach to logical inference, whether model or proof-based; (2) the syntax of the used logical theories; (3) the logical semantics of the systems and their extensions to facilitate learning; (4) the scope of learning, encompassing either parameter or structure learning; (5) the presence of symbolic and subsymbolic representations; (6) the degree to which systems capture the original logic, probabilistic, and neural paradigms; and (7) the classes of learning tasks the systems are applied to. By positioning various NeSy and StarAI systems along these dimensions and pointing out similarities and differences between them, this survey contributes fundamental concepts for understanding the integration of learning and reasoning.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To identify potential predictors of response and resistance mechanisms in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC) treated with the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor abemaciclib ± endocrine therapy (ET), baseline and acquired genomic alterations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were analyzed and associated with clinical outcomes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MONARCH 3: postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC and no prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting were randomly assigned to abemaciclib or placebo plus nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). nextMONARCH: women with HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer that progressed on/after prior ET and chemotherapy were randomly assigned to abemaciclib alone (two doses) or plus tamoxifen. Baseline and end-of-treatment plasma samples from patients in MONARCH 3 and nextMONARCH (monotherapy arms) were analyzed to identify somatic genomic alterations. Association between genomic alterations and median progression-free survival (mPFS) was assessed. RESULTS: Most patients had ≥1 genomic alteration detected in baseline ctDNA. In MONARCH 3, abemaciclib+NSAI was associated with improved mPFS versus placebo+NSAI, regardless of baseline alterations. ESR1 alterations were less frequently acquired in the abemaciclib+NSAI arm than placebo+NSAI. Acquired alterations potentially associated with resistance to abemaciclib ± NSAI included RB1 and MYC. CONCLUSIONS: In MONARCH 3, certain baseline ctDNA genomic alterations were prognostic for ET but not predictive of abemaciclib response. Further studies are warranted to assess whether ctDNA alterations acquired during abemaciclib treatment differ from other CDK4/6 inhibitors. Findings are hypothesis generating; further exploration is warranted into mechanisms of resistance to abemaciclib and ET. See related commentary by Wander and Bardia, p. 2008.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: MONARCH 3, a phase III trial (NCT02246621) of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC), previously demonstrated significantly improved progression-free survival in patients receiving abemaciclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). This study evaluated patient-reported outcomes, including global health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functioning, and symptoms. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily; n = 328) or placebo (n = 165), plus 1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole daily. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 and Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire HRQoL instruments were administered at baseline, every two cycles during cycles 2 through 19 (each cycle being 28 days), every three cycles thereafter, and once at a short-term posttherapy follow-up visit (approximately 30 days after discontinuation). Longitudinal mixed regression and Cox proportional hazards models evaluated postbaseline change and time to sustained deterioration (TTSD), respectively. RESULTS: Baseline scores were similar between treatment arms. Although select scores statistically favored the placebo arm, global HRQoL, most symptoms, and functioning scales did not meet the threshold for clinically meaningful differences between treatment arms. Only diarrhea favored the placebo arm with statistically and clinically meaningful differences. There were no TTSD differences between treatment arms for global HRQoL, most symptoms (except diarrhea), or functioning. CONCLUSION: Over a 2-year period, there were no clinically meaningful differences in global HRQoL, functioning, and most symptoms for patients receiving abemaciclib plus NSAI compared with NSAI alone. Only diarrhea favored the placebo arm, consistent with prior safety data, which has been shown to be manageable and reversible. Combined with clinical efficacy, results support treatment with abemaciclib plus NSAI for postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The addition of abemaciclib to a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) was not associated with a clinically meaningful detriment in patient-reported global health-related quality of life, functioning, and most symptoms in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). Prior studies have also demonstrated clinical efficacy of abemaciclib plus NSAI compared with NSAI alone, including improved progression-free survival and objective response rate. These results also complement previously reported toxicity data, as measured by investigator-assessed adverse events. Taken together, these results support treatment with abemaciclib plus NSAI for postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC.",

In MONARCH 3, the addition of abemaciclib to a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) as initial therapy for HR+, HER2- ABC significantly improved PFS. Here, we present the prespecified final OS results for MONARCH 3. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MONARCH 3 is a randomized, double-blind, phase III study of abemaciclib plus NSAI (anastrozole or letrozole) versus placebo plus NSAI in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC without prior systemic therapy in the advanced setting. The primary objective was investigator-assessed PFS; OS was a gated secondary endpoint, and chemotherapy-free survival was an exploratory endpoint. RESULTS: A total of 493 women were randomized 2 : 1 to receive abemaciclib plus NSAI (n = 328) or placebo plus NSAI (n = 165). After a median follow-up of 8.1 years, there were 198 OS events (60.4%) in the abemaciclib arm and 116 (70.3%) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 0.804; 95% confidence interval 0.637-1.015; P = 0.0664, non-significant). Median OS was 66.8 versus 53.7 months for abemaciclib versus placebo. In the subgroup with visceral disease, there were 113 OS events (65.3%) in the abemaciclib arm and 65 (72.2%) in the placebo arm (hazard ratio, 0.758; 95% confidence interval 0.558-1.030; P = 0.0757, non-significant). Median OS was 63.7 months versus 48.8 months for abemaciclib versus placebo. The previously demonstrated PFS benefit was sustained, and chemotherapy-free survival numerically improved with the addition of abemaciclib. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Abemaciclib combined with an NSAI resulted in clinically meaningful improvement in median OS (intent-to-treat population: 13.1 months; subgroup with visceral disease: 14.9 months) in patients with HR+ HER2- ABC; however, statistical significance was not reached.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To describe the demographic characteristics of gender, age, and presence of repetitive movements, intake of alcohol and non-steroid anti-inflammatories (NSAI), medical specialties that referred patients to nerve conduction studies and electromyography (NCS-EMG), school attainment, and seasonal distribution in patients with a neurophysiological diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Method: A series of 1039 patients (11549 hands) with neurophysiologically defined CTS was studied. Patients were referred for NCS-EMG in 3 universities and 2 private services, from August 2001 to January 2003. All patients completed a questionnaire containing demographic information. The diagnosis of CTS was established following a pre-established protocol, with defined diagnostic criteria. Results: Around one fourth of patients had already performed NCS-EMG; the greatest frequency of CTS was observed in women (5.6:1) and in patients above the age of 40. Most patients reported performing repetitive movements in their daily routine (69.7%); 12.9% reported use of NSAI and 14.9% regular intake of alcoholic beverages. A greater frequency of CTS was observed in the months of July and August, when compared to the other months of the year. Around 2/3 of the study population had completed at least secondary school. Most requests of nerve conduction studies did not provide a diagnostic hypothesis (59.9%) and neurophysiologic studies were requested mostly by traumatology/orthopedics (71.1%). Conclusion: We have concluded that, in our environment, CTS shows some demographical characteristics that are similar to what the literature describes. Also, we have found that most of our sample concluded at least secondary school, and was referred to neurophysiologic studies by orthopedists. To be pointed out is the seasonal distribution of CTS, which demonstrates a significant association with winter months.",

The importance of preventing the appearance of these pharmacological interactions is because these are medicaments prescribed daily in odontology for moderate pain treatment and inflammation in the oral cavity. Paracetamol can interact with warfarin and therefore care should be taken with chronic alcoholic patients. All NSAIs reduce renal blood flow and consequently are capable of reducing the efficacy of medicaments used for treating arterial hypertension, which act via a renal mechanism. Especial attention should be taken considering the risk of interaction between the antagonists of AT1 receptors of angiostensin II (ARAII) and the NSAIs.",

    "abstract": "Meloxicam, a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, is a commonly used NSAID in pigs. Besides having potential side effects on the gastrointestinal tract, this type of drug might potentially affect osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, processes relevant to growing pigs. Therefore, the effects of long-term meloxicam treatment on growing pigs were studied. Twelve piglets (n=6 receiving daily meloxicam 0.4 mg/kg orally from 48 until 110 days of age; n=6 receiving only applesauce (vehicle control)) were subjected to visual and objective gait analysis by pressure plate measurements at several time points. Following euthanasia a complete postmortem examination was performed and samples of the talus and distal tibia, including the distal physis, were collected. Trabecular bone microarchitecture was analysed by microCT scanning, bone stiffness by compression testing and growth plate morphology using light microscopy. Animals were not lame and gait patterns did not differ between the groups. Pathological examination revealed no lesions compatible with known side effects of NSAIDs. Trabecular bone microarchitecture and growth plate morphology did not differ between the two groups. The findings of this in vivo study reduce concerns regarding the long-term use of meloxicam in young, growing piglets.",

In the work of (Makiguchi and Sawamura, 2007a) (Makiguchi and Sawamura, 2007b), they constructed a simple but versatile neural network for the grounded semantics (the least fixed point semantics) in the Dung's abstract argumentation framework (Dung, 1995). This paper further develop its theory so that it can decide which argumentation semantics (admissible, stable, complete semantics) a given set of arguments falls into. In doing so, we construct a more simple but versatile neural network that can compute all extensions of the argumentation semantics. The result leads to a neural-symbolic system for argumentation.",

    "year": "2024",
    "author": "Graf, Peter and Emami, Patrick",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic AI combines the interpretability, parsimony, and explicit reasoning of classical symbolic approaches with the statistical learning of data-driven neural approaches. Models and policies that are simultaneously differentiable and interpretable may be key enablers of this marriage. This paper demonstrates three pathways to implementing such models and policies in a real-world reinforcement learning setting. Specifically, we study a broad class of neural networks that build interpretable semantics directly into their architecture. We reveal and highlight both the potential and the essential difficulties of combining logic, simulation, and learning. One lesson is that learning benefits from continuity and differentiability, but classical logic is discrete and non-differentiable. The relaxation to real-valued, differentiable representations presents a trade-off; the more learnable, the less interpretable. Another lesson is that using logic in the context of a numerical simulation involves a non-trivial mapping from raw (e.g., real-valued time series) simulation data to logical predicates. Some open questions this note exposes include: What are the limits of rule-based controllers, and how learnable are they? Do the differentiable interpretable approaches discussed here scale to large, complex, uncertain systems? Can we truly achieve interpretability? We highlight these and other themes across the three approaches.",

A combination of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, together with some traditional programming methods and techniques - image processing algorithms and libraries, dedicated libraries for ontology building and programming interface, have been selected to support the implementation of a self-supervised ontology learning for natural hazard identification and monitoring. The specific use of CNN or GCN will depend on the specific tasks, but here we consider a hybrid approach that use both CNN and GCN, where CNN could be used to extract features from images which then serves as inputs to a GCN.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment of CRCs are of importance for improving the survival. In the present study, we studied the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)-induced chemopreventive effects on tumor development incidence and angiogenesis in experimental CRC rats. 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) was used as cancer-inducing agent and two NSAIDs (celecoxib and diclofenac) were given orally as chemopreventive agents. Histopathological and immuno histochemical evaluations were performed in colorectal tissue samples, whereas angiogenesis parameters were studied in blood samples. Histopathological examination showed that adenocarcinoma (62.5%), dysplastic changes (31.25%) and inflammattory changes (6.25%) were detected in DMH group, whereas no pathological change was observed in control rats. In treatment groups, there was marked decrease in adenocarcinoma rate (30% and 10%, respectively). A significant increase was detected in MMP-2, MMP-9 levels and MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio in DMH group as compared with controls and treatment groups. In immunohistochemical evaluations, there was an increase in intensity and extent of staining of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in DMH group as compared to controls and treatment groups. The decrease in celecoxib group was more prominent. Overall, it was concluded that NSAIDs, particularly cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, might have a protective effect on CRC development and slow down progression of tumor in a DMH-induced experimental cancer model. One of the possible mechanisms in the chemoprevention of colon cancer seems to be inhibition of angiogenesis by diclofenac and celecoxib.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Ontologies are used in various domains, with RDF and OWL being prominent standards for ontology development. RDF is favored for its simplicity and flexibility, while OWL enables detailed domain knowledge representation. However, as ontologies grow larger and more expressive, reasoning complexity increases, and traditional reasoners struggle to perform efficiently. Despite optimization efforts, scalability remains an issue. Additionally, advancements in automated knowledge base construction have created large and expressive ontologies that are often noisy and inconsistent, posing further challenges for conventional reasoners. To address these challenges, researchers have explored neuro-symbolic approaches that combine neural networks' learning capabilities with symbolic systems' reasoning abilities. In this chapter,we provide an overview of the existing literature in the field of neuro-symbolic deductive reasoning supported by RDF(S), the description logics EL and ALC, and OWL 2 RL, discussing the techniques employed, the tasks they address, and other relevant efforts in this area.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: International guidelines recommend cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i)-based first-line therapy for hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) advanced breast cancer (ABC). However, direct drug comparisons are lacking. We aimed to identify the most effective and safe therapy through network meta-analysis (NMA). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and OpenGrey up to September 30, 2023. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing endocrine therapy alone or in combination with CDK4/6i as first-line endocrine treatment for HR+/HER2- ABC patients. The hazard ratios for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and relative risks for objective response rate and adverse events (AEs) were available in selected trials. We performed a Bayesian NMA following PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs, involving 10 treatments, were included. Most studies were at low risk of bias. Regarding PFS, ribociclib+fulvestrant ranked first with a surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) of 85.0%, followed by dalpiciclib+nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) (SUCRA = 78.9%). Considering OS, the top three ranked treatments were ribociclib+fulvestrant (SUCRA = 94.1%), abemaciclib+NSAI (SUCRA = 69.9%), and ribociclib+NSAI (SUCRA = 68.5%). Out of four CDK4/6is, ribociclib minimized the grade 3/4 AEs, while dalpiciclib demonstrated the worst safety. Publication bias could not be ignored in our analyses, and the certainty of evidence was downgraded primarily due to imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: Ribociclib+fulvestrant probably represents the best option in a first-line setting. When combined with NSAI, dalpiciclib likely showed the best efficacy but the worst safety. Abemaciclib+NSAI and ribociclib+NSAI could also be promising treatments, while palbociclib presented inferiority. (PROSPERO Registration No. CRD42022370271).",

In this paper, we propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic architecture that bridges this gap (in one direction), first, by translating a first-order input into a variable-free topos representation and second, by learning models of logical theories on the neural level by equations induced by this topos. As a side-effect of this approach the network memorizes a whole model of the training input and allows to build the core of a framework for integrated cognition.",

Then I will look in more detail at some of the `engineering details' of its implementation (or lack thereof) in each of these settings. In other words, the question posed is: What is actually happening? For example, we previously found that humans overwhelmingly seek, create or imagine context in order to provide meaning when presented with abstract, apparently incomplete, contradictory or otherwise untenable decision-making situations. Humans are intolerant of contradiction and will greatly simplify to avoid it. They can partially correlate but do not average. Human learning is not Boolean. These and other human reasoning properties will then be taken to critique how well artificial intelligence methods and quantum mechanical modelling might compete with them in decision-making tasks within psychology and economics.",

    "abstract": "To investigate whether the spatial frequency processing under stereopsis proceeds in a top-down manner, Weisstein''s experiment based on the neural symbolic activity hypothesis was replicated under stereoscopic viewing condition. Five undergraduates inspected a grating which was partially blocked from view with a stereoscopically raised rectangle, then estimated the apparent contrast of a test grating subsequently presented within a portion where the grating was truncated, and at the same depth plane as the grating. Corresponding to the perceptual interpretation of the overall configuration in which the background grating virtually appears to continue behind the raised rectangle, a significant differential depression was obtained in apparent contrast of the test grating. It was confirmed that such a differential adaptation effect showed orientation-selectivity, as Weisstein reported. Apparently pattern recognition under stereopsis proceeds in a top-down sequence, where an entire, global configuration is processed first and then component spatial frequencies are deduced from its outcome.",

Specifically, we examine challenges and opportunities in leveraging deep learning techniques for improving legal reasoning using PROLEG identifying four distinct options ranging from enhancing fact extraction using deep learning to end-to-end solutions for reasoning with textual legal descriptions. We assess advantages and limitations of each option, considering their technical feasibility, interpretability, and alignment with the needs of legal practitioners and decision-makers. We believe that our analysis can serve as a guideline for developers aiming to build effective decision-support systems for the legal domain, while fostering a deeper understanding of challenges and potential advancements by neuro-symbolic approaches in legal applications.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer and its treatments are associated with a detrimental effect on bone health. Here we report the results of an exploratory analysis assessing changes in levels of biomarkers of bone metabolism in patients enrolled in the phase IIIb 4EVER study. METHODS: The 4EVER trial investigated everolimus in combination with exemestane in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In this prespecified exploratory analysis, changes in biomarkers of bone turnover were assessed in patients from baseline to weeks 4, 12, and 24. The serum bone markers assessed were procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-vitamin D). On-treatment changes in bone markers over time were described per subgroup of interest and efficacy outcomes. RESULTS: Bone marker data were available for 241 of 299 enrolled patients. At the final assessment, P1NP, osteocalcin, PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D (all P < 0.001), and CTX (P = 0.036) were significantly decreased from baseline values per the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. At the last assessment (24 weeks or earlier), levels of serum CTX and PTH were significantly lower (P = 0.009 and P = 0.034, respectively) among patients with vs. without prior antiresorptive treatment (ART). Serum CTX levels were significantly lower (P < 0.001), and 25-OH-vitamin D concentrations significantly higher (P = 0.029), at the last postbaseline assessment in patients receiving concomitant ART vs. those without ART. Changes from baseline in PTH and 25-OH-vitamin D concentrations to the final assessment were significantly smaller in patients with prior ART. Lower baseline serum concentrations of osteocalcin and PTH were associated with clinical response (partial vs. non-response) at 24 weeks. High serum levels of CTX and P1NP at baseline were risk factors for progression at 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: These exploratory analyses support use of everolimus plus exemestane for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer, and add to the body of evidence suggesting a potentially favorable impact of everolimus on bone turnover.

    "abstract": "The traditional approaches-of symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) and of sub-symbolic neural networks-towards artificial cognition have not been very successful. The rule-based symbolic AI approach has proven to be brittle and unable to provide any real intelligence (Mckenna, Artificial intelligence and neural networks: steps toward principled integration, Academic Press, USA, 1994). On the other hand, traditional artificial neural networks have not been able to advance very much beyond pattern recognition and classification. This shortcoming has been credited to the inability of conventional artificial neural networks to handle syntax and symbols. Hybrid approaches that combine symbolic AI and sub-symbolic neural networks have been tried with results that fall short of the ultimate goal. It has been argued that traditional AI programs do not operate with meanings and consequently do not understand anything (Searle, Minds, brains & science, Penguin Books Ltd, London, 1984; Searle, The mystery of consciousness, Granta Books, London, 1997). It seems that in this way some essential ingredient is missing, but there may be a remedy available. Associative information processing principles may enable the utilization of meaning and the combined sub-symbolic/symbolic operation of neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Existing technology allows us to build robots that mimic human cognition quite successfully, but would this make these robots conscious? Would these robots really feel something and experience their existence in the world in the style of the human conscious experience? Most probably not. In order to create true conscious and sentient robots we must first consider carefully what consciousness really is; what exactly would constitute the phenomenal conscious experience. This leads to the investigation of the explanatory gap and the hard problem of consciousness and also the problem of qualia. This investigation leads to the essential requirements for conscious artifacts and these are: 1.) The realization of a perception process with qualia and percept location externalization, 2.) The realization of the introspection of the mental content, 3.) The reporting allowed by seamless integration of the various modules and 4.) A grounded self-concept with the equivalent of a somatosensory system. Cognitive architectures that are based on perception/response feedback loops and associative sub-symbolic/symbolic neural processing would seem to satisfy these requirements.",

    "abstract": "Complex networks describe important structures in nature and society, composed of nodes and the edges that connect them. The evolution of these networks is typically described by dynamics, which are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge to derive. However, because the complex network involves noisy observations from multiple trajectories of nodes, existing symbolic regression methods are either not applicable or ineffective on its dynamics. In this paper, we propose Physically Inspired Neural Dynamics Symbolic Regression (PI-NDSR), a method based on neural networks and genetic programming to automatically learn the symbolic expression of dynamics. Our method consists of two key components: a Physically Inspired Neural Dynamics (PIND) to augment and denoise trajectories through observed trajectory interpolation; and a coordinated genetic search algorithm to derive symbolic expressions. This algorithm leverages references of node dynamics and edge dynamics from neural dynamics to avoid overfitted expressions in symbolic space. We evaluate our method on synthetic datasets generated by various dynamics and real datasets on disease spreading. The results demonstrate that",

    "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence was embraced as an idea of simulating unique abilities of humans, such as thinking, self-improvement, and expressing their feelings using different languages. The idea of “Programs with Common Sense\" was the main and central goal of Classical AI; it was, mainly built around an internal, updatable cognitive model of the world. But, now almost all the proposed models and approaches lacked reasoning and cognitive models and have been transferred to be more data driven. In this paper, different approaches and techniques of AI are reviewed, specifying how these approaches strayed from the main goal of Classical AI, and emphasizing how to return to its main objective. Additionally, most of the terms and concepts used in this field such as Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Deep Learning are highlighted. Moreover, the relations among these terms are determined, trying to remove mysterious and ambiguities around them. The transition from the Classical AI to Neuro-Symbolic AI and the need for new Cognitive-based models are also explained and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Application of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in search and rescue, emergency management, and law enforcement has gained traction with the advent of low-cost platforms and sensor payloads. The emergence of hybrid neural and symbolic AI approaches for complex reasoning is expected to further push the boundaries of these applications with decreasing levels of human intervention. However, current UAV simulation environments lack semantic context suited to this hybrid approach. To address this gap, HAMERITT (Hybrid Ai Mission Environment for RapId Training and Testing) provides a simulation-based autonomy software framework that supports the training, testing and assurance of neuro-symbolic algorithms for autonomous maneuver and perception reasoning. HAMERITT includes scenario generation capabilities that offer mission-relevant contextual symbolic information in addition to raw sensor data. Scenarios include symbolic descriptions for entities of interest and their relations to scene elements, as well as spatial-temporal constraints in the form of time-bounded areas of interest with prior probabilities and restricted zones within those areas. HAMERITT also features support for training distinct algorithm threads for maneuver vs. perception within an end-to-end mission run. Future work includes improving scenario realism and scaling symbolic context generation through automated workflow.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic integration merges background knowledge and neural networks to provide a more effective learning system. It uses the Core Method as a means to encode rules. However, this method has several drawbacks in dealing with rules that have temporal extent. First, it demands some interface with the world which buffers the input patterns so they can be represented all at once. This imposes a rigid limit on the duration of patterns and further suggests that all input vectors be the same length. These are troublesome in domains where one would like comparable representations for patterns that are of variable length (e.g. language). Second, it does not allow dynamic insertion of rules conveniently. Finally and also most seriously, it cannot encode rules having preconditions satisfied at non-deterministic time points - an important class of rules. This paper presents novel methods for encoding such rules, thereby improves and extends the power of the state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic integration.",

    "abstract": "Automated medical report generation in spine radiology, i.e., given spinal medical images and directly create radiologist-level diagnosis reports to support clinical decision making, is a novel yet fundamental study in the domain of artificial intelligence in healthcare. However, it is incredibly challenging because it is an extremely complicated task that involves visual perception and high-level reasoning processes. In this paper, we propose the neural-symbolic learning (NSL) framework that performs human-like learning by unifying deep neural learning and symbolic logical reasoning for the spinal medical report generation. Generally speaking, the NSL framework firstly employs deep neural learning to imitate human visual perception for detecting abnormalities of target spinal structures. Concretely, we design an adversarial graph network that interpolates a symbolic graph reasoning module into a generative adversarial network through embedding prior domain knowledge, achieving semantic segmentation of spinal structures with high complexity and variability. NSL secondly conducts human-like symbolic logical reasoning that realizes unsupervised causal effect analysis of detected entities of abnormalities through meta-interpretive learning. NSL finally fills these discoveries of target diseases into a unified template, successfully achieving a comprehensive medical report generation. When employed in a real-world clinical dataset, a series of empirical studies demonstrate its capacity on spinal medical report generation and show that our algorithm remarkably exceeds existing methods in the detection of spinal structures. These indicate its potential as a clinical tool that contributes to computer-aided diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Neuro-Symbolic AI (NSAI) is an emerging paradigm that integrates neural networks with symbolic reasoning to enhance the transparency, reasoning capabilities, and data efficiency of AI systems. Recent NSAI systems have gained traction due to their exceptional performance in reasoning tasks and human-AI collaborative scenarios. Despite these algorithmic advancements, executing NSAI tasks on existing hardware (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, TPUs) remains challenging, due to their heterogeneous computing kernels, high memory intensity, and unique memory access patterns. Moreover, current NSAI algorithms exhibit significant variation in operation types and scales, making them incompatible with existing ML accelerators. These challenges highlight the need for a versatile and flexible acceleration framework tailored to NSAI workloads. In this paper, we propose NSFlow, an FPGA-based acceleration framework designed to achieve high efficiency, scalability, and versatility across NSAI systems. NSFlow features a design architecture generator that identifies workload data dependencies and creates optimized dataflow architectures, as well as a reconfigurable array with flexible compute units, re-organizable memory, and mixed-precision capabilities. Evaluating across NSAI workloads, NSFlow achieves 31x speedup over Jetson TX2, more than 2x over GPU, 8x speedup over TPU-like systolic array, and more than 3x over Xilinx DPU. NSFlow also demonstrates enhanced scalability, with only 4x runtime increase when symbolic workloads scale by 150x. To the best of our knowledge, NSFlow is the first framework to enable real-time generalizable NSAI algorithms acceleration, demonstrating a promising solution for next-generation cognitive systems.",

    "abstract": "[LANGUAGE=”English”]Objective:This study aimed to determine pain treatment methods applied in intensive care units in our country, specifically the frequency of regional analgesia use and attitudes and approaches to regional analgesia, using a questionnaire.Materials and Methods:Our study was organized as a cross-sectional survey in the form of a questionnaire. A web-based questionnaire containing 31 questions was sent to specialist physicians working in the intensive care unit via e-mail. The questionnaire was sent to the participants 4 times at intervals of 4 weeks. Participants who were unable to complete the questionnaire within 4 months were considered as rejecting participation.Results:A total of 130 specialist physicians working in the intensive care unit participated in our study, wherein 45.4% stated the presence of protocol for analgesia in the intensive care unit. The highest rate of preferred methods for pain treatment was found to be opioids, followed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other pharmacological agents, and regional analgesia, respectively. Lumbar epidural, thoracic epidural, peripheral nerve blocks, and local infiltration were the most preferred regional analgesia methods, but it is noteworthy that the rate of regional analgesia methods was low even in cases with appropriate indications. Factors that prevent the use of regional analgesia were hemodynamic instability (53.1%), coagulation profile variability (49.2%), and easier alternative analgesia methods (44.6%). Notably, the incidence of complications in regional analgesia methods was generally very low.Conclusion:The most commonly used drugs for pain management in intensive care units were opioids and NSAIDs. A majority of the participants expressed their belief in the useful effects of regional analgesia in patients although these methods were rarely used in intensive care units.[LANGUAGE=”Turkish”]Amaç:Çalışmamızda ülkemizde yoğun bakım ünitelerinde uygulanan ağrı tedavisi yöntemleri ve özellikle rejyonel analjezi uygulanma sıklığı ile rejyonel analjezi uygulamalarına ilişkin tutum ve yaklaşımların bir anket aracılığı ile belirlenmesi amaçlanmıştır.Gereç ve Yöntem:Çalışmamız anket niteliğinde kesitsel bir araştırma olarak düzenlendi.

It outlines the scope of logical reasoning in LLMs, its theoretical foundations, and the benchmarks used to evaluate reasoning proficiency. We analyze existing capabilities across different reasoning paradigms - deductive, inductive, abductive, and analogical - and assess strategies to enhance reasoning performance, including data-centric tuning, reinforcement learning, decoding strategies, and neuro-symbolic approaches. The review concludes with future directions, emphasizing the need for further exploration to strengthen logical reasoning in AI systems.",

    "abstract": "A variety of prostaglandins (PG) protect the gastric and intestinal mucosa when given before damaging agents such as absolute ethanol, acidified taurocholate, boiling water or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAI). A synthetic prostaglandin, 16,16-dimethyl PGE2, shown to be cytoprotective at physiologic levels to the above agents was given to mice 1 h before or 15 min after 137Cs whole-body .gamma.-irradiation. The survival of intestinal stem cells measured by their ability to form in situ colonies of regenerating epithelium was increased when 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 was given before but not after 137Cs .gamma.-irradiation. The maximum degree of 16,16-dimethyl PGE2-induced radioprotection was seen when the drug was given 1 h before irradiation. No radioprotection was seen when the interval between drug and irradiation was 3 h or longer. When the time between 16,16-dimethyl PGE2 and irradiation was kept at 1 h, the degree of radioprotection was dependent on the PG drug dose. There was a steep rise in the number of surviving cells at low doses of PG. These results imply that tumors which secrete PGE2 may in part be protected from the lethal effects of ionizing photon radiation.",

    "abstract": "Current subgraph retrieval methods generally fall into two categories: those that rely on semantic matching, which use only surface-level semantic information of relations and lack flexibility; and those based on personalized PageRank algorithms, which fail to leverage the semantic connection between the relation and the question, rendering them susceptible to noisy data. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel retrieval model that employs hybrid semantics of relations and path representations. Specifically, hybrid semantics involves merging relational and entity information within a knowledge graph to extract the deep semantics of relations and enhance semantic representation by integrating it with the explicit descriptive text of the relations. Path representation merges the semantics of the current relation with those of preceding ones to form a complete path representation. This representation is then semantically matched with the question to compute a score, which determines whether the relation should form part of the subgraph. We integrated our subgraph retrieval model with the Neural Symbolic Machine (NSM) reasoning model and evaluated it on the publicly available CWQ and WebQSP datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method performs exceptionally well on these datasets, validating the efficacy of utilizing deep semantics and path representations for the retrieval of subgraphs in response to complex questions.",

We show that the learnability of NeSy tasks can be characterized by their derived constraint satisfaction problems (DCSPs). Specifically, a task is learnable if the corresponding DCSP has a unique solution; otherwise, it is unlearnable. For learnable tasks, we establish error bounds by exploiting the clustering property of the hypothesis space. Additionally, we analyze the asymptotic error for general NeSy tasks, showing that the expected error scales with the disagreement among solutions. Our results offer a principled approach to determining learnability and provide insights into the design of new algorithms.",

    "abstract": "This article explores the convergence of connectionist and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI), from historical debates to contemporary advancements. Traditionally considered distinct paradigms, connectionist AI focuses on neural networks, while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic representation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4, highlight the potential of connectionist architectures in handling human language as a form of symbols. The study argues that LLM-empowered Autonomous Agents (LAAs) embody this paradigm convergence. By utilizing LLMs for text-based knowledge modeling and representation, LAAs integrate neuro-symbolic AI principles, showcasing enhanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities. Comparing LAAs with Knowledge Graphs within the neuro-symbolic AI theme highlights the unique strengths of LAAs in mimicking human-like reasoning processes, scaling effectively with large datasets, and leveraging in-context samples without explicit re-training. The research underscores promising avenues in neuro-vector-symbolic integration, instructional encoding, and implicit reasoning, aimed at further enhancing LAA capabilities. By exploring the progression of neuro-symbolic AI and proposing future research trajectories, this work advances the understanding and development of AI technologies.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of certifying the robustness of deep neural networks against real-world distribution shifts. To do so, we bridge the gap between hand-crafted specifications and realistic deployment settings by proposing a novel neural-symbolic verification framework, in which we train a generative model to learn perturbations from data and define specifications with respect to the output of the learned model. A unique challenge arising from this setting is that existing verifiers cannot tightly approximate sigmoid activations, which are fundamental to many state-of-the-art generative models. To address this challenge, we propose a general meta-algorithm for handling sigmoid activations which leverages classical notions of counter-example-guided abstraction refinement. The key idea is to lazily refine the abstraction of sigmoid functions to exclude spurious counter-examples found in the previous abstraction, thus guaranteeing progress in the verification process while keeping the state-space small. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods on a range of challenging distribution shifts.",

    "abstract": "The integration between connectionist learning and logic-based reasoning is a longstanding foundational question in artificial intelligence, cognitive systems, and computer science in general. Research into neural-symbolic integration aims to tackle this challenge, developing approaches bridging the gap between sub-symbolic and symbolic representation and computation. In this line of work the core method has been suggested as a way of translating logic programs into a multilayer perceptron computing least models of the programs. In particular, a variant of the core method for three valued Lukasiewicz logic has proven to be applicable to cognitive modelling among others in the context of Byrne's suppression task. Building on the underlying formal results and the corresponding computational framework, the present article provides a modified core method suitable for the supervised learning of Lukasiewicz logic (and of a closely-related variant thereof), implements and executes the corresponding supervised learning with the backpropagation algorithm and, finally, constructs a rule extraction method in order to close the neural-symbolic cycle. The resulting system is then evaluated in several empirical test cases, and recommendations for future developments are derived. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

We extend recently proposed Neuro Symbolic Concept Learning (NSCL), which has been quite effective for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), for the task of image manipulation. Our system referred to as NeuroSIM can perform complex multi-hop reasoning over multi-object scenes and only requires weak supervision in the form of annotated data for VQA. NeuroSIM parses an instruction into a symbolic program, based on a Domain Specific Language (DSL) comprising of object attributes and manipulation operations, that guides its execution. We create a new dataset for the task, and extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuroSIM is highly competitive with or beats SOTA baselines that make use of supervised data for manipulation.",

    "abstract": "A model of human cognition is presented in which peripheral sensory images are selectively enhanced by corticofugal pathways. The same processes also generate quasi-sensory mental images even in the absence of sensory stimulation. This inversion of forward sensory processing can come about through hillclimbing algorithms or a type of Hebbian synaptic facilitation I call inverse learning. The neural mechanisms that enable us to simulate actions and evaluate alternative scenarios, are described as internal sketchpads. It is further argued that early artistic expression and language origin can be understood as natural extensions of cognitive processes in which central symbolic neural activity is projected outward to generate images and symbols.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumor segmentation (BTS) has been studied from handcrafted engineered features to conventional machine learning (ML) methods, followed by the cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Each recent approach has attempted to overcome the challenges of previous methods and brought conveniences in efficacy, throughput, computation, explainability, investigation, and interpretability. Recently, deep learning (DL) algorithms show excellent performance regarding diverse fields, including image process, computer vision, health analytics, autonomous vehicles, and natural language processes; however, ultimately impediment in making the artificial intelligence explainable and interpretable to clinicians while dealing with critical health informatics and radiomics. Besides the sophisticated deep learning models for brain tumor segmentation, notorious notions like explainability, investigation, trust, and interpretability of DL raised significant concerns for clinicians in their domains. Among many DL methods, the neuro-symbolic learning (NSL) concept has gained more attention as it can contribute to explainable and interpretable AI. In the current study, we survey the prominent approaches, from handcrafted engineering conventional ML to deep learning algorithms, highlight the challenges in DL algorithms, and propose NSL architectures for BTS. Compared to existing surveys, our study not only outlines handcrafted to DL methods for BTS but also proposed explainable and interpretable pipelines appropriate for clinical practices. Our study can better facilitate novice learners in explainable AI and propose efficient, robust, interpretable DL models to facilitate the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of BTS.",

    "abstract": "Chemical data is increasingly openly available in databases such as PubChem, which contains approximately 110 million compound entries as of February 2021. With the availability of data at such scale, the burden has shifted to organisation, analysis and interpretation. Chemical ontologies provide structured classifications of chemical entities that can be used for navigation and filtering of the large chemical space. ChEBI is a prominent example of a chemical ontology, widely used in life science contexts. However, ChEBI is manually maintained and as such cannot easily scale to the full scope of public chemical data. There is a need for tools that are able to automatically classify chemical data into chemical ontologies, which can be framed as a hierarchical multi-class classification problem. In this paper we evaluate machine learning approaches for this task, comparing different learning frameworks including logistic regression, decision trees and long short-term memory artificial neural networks, and different encoding approaches for the chemical structures, including cheminformatics fingerprints and character-based encoding from chemical line notation representations. We find that classical learning approaches such as logistic regression perform well with sets of relatively specific, disjoint chemical classes, while the neural network is able to handle larger sets of overlapping classes but needs more examples per class to learn from, and is not able to make a class prediction for every molecule. Future work will explore hybrid and ensemble approaches, as well as alternative network architectures including neuro-symbolic approaches.",

Increasing numbers of surgical patients are chronically taking some form of an NSAI drug. We examined the effects of `'chronic'' intramuscular ketorolac on the healing of a closed linear surgical wound in the rat. Wistar rats were pretreated with 4 mg per kilogram per day ketorolac intramuscularly prior to receiving dorsal incisional wounds. The ketorolac treatment was continued and after 2 weeks the wounds were excised and separated with a tensiometer to measure mechanical properties. Breaking strength was directly measured, tensile strength was calculated, and collagen concentrations at the wound site were determined. A significant decrease in the mean breaking strength was seen in the ketorolac-treated animals when compared to controls. The ketorolac-treated animals had a mean tensile strength less than the controls, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. The mean collagen concentration of the ketorolac-treated wounds was significantly less than the untreated wounds. Use of ketorolac for just I week prior to surgery in rats produced a significant decrease in the breaking strength of their wounds. With the increasing use of ketorolac in surgical patients as well as the increasing use of oral NSAI drugs, more study of this effect is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) means to identify fine-grained aspects, opinions, and sentiment polarities. Recent ABSA research focuses on utilizing multi-task learning (MTL) to achieve less computational costs and better performance. However, there are certain limits in MTL-based ABSA. For example, unbalanced labels and sub-task learning difficulties may result in the biases that some labels and sub-tasks are overfitting, while the others are underfitting. To address these issues, inspired by neuro-symbolic learning systems, we propose a meta-based self-training method with a meta-weighter (MSM). We believe that a generalizable model can be achieved by appropriate symbolic representation selection (in-domain knowledge) and effective learning control (regulation) in a neural system. Thus, MSM trains a teacher model to generate in-domain knowledge (e.g., unlabeled data selection and pseudo-label generation), where the generated pseudo-labels are used by a student model for supervised learning. Then, the meta-weighter of MSM is jointly trained with the student model to provide each instance with sub-task-specific weights to coordinate their convergence rates, balancing class labels, and alleviating noise impacts introduced from self-training. The following experiments indicate that MSM can utilize 50% labeled data to achieve comparable results to state-of-arts models in ABSA and outperform them with all labeled data.",

Due to the unstructured environment and high uncertainties, battery disassembly is still primarily done by humans, probably assisted by robots.

This paper proposes a novel framework of the NeuroSymbolic task and motion planning method to disassemble batteries in an unstructured environment using robots automatically. It enables robots to independently locate and disassemble battery bolts, with or without obstacles. This study not only provides a solution for intelligently disassembling electric vehicle batteries but also verifies its feasibility through a set of test results with the robot accomplishing the disassembly tasks in a complex and dynamic environment.",

    "abstract": "The recent developments and growing interest in neural-symbolic models has shown that hybrid approaches can offer richer models for Artificial Intelligence. The integration of effective relational learning and reasoning methods is one of the key challenges in this direction, as neural learning and symbolic reasoning offer complementary characteristics that can benefit the development of AI systems. Relational labelling or link prediction on knowledge graphs has become one of the main problems in deep learning-based natural language processing research. Moreover, other fields which make use of neural-symbolic techniques may also benefit from such research endeavours. There have been several efforts towards the identification of missing facts from existing ones in knowledge graphs. Two lines of research try and predict knowledge relations between two entities by considering all known facts connecting them or several paths of facts connecting them. We propose a neural-symbolic graph neural network which applies learning over all the paths by feeding the model with the embedding of the minimal subset of the knowledge graph containing such paths. By learning to produce representations for entities and facts corresponding to word embeddings, we show how the model can be trained end-to-end to decode these representations and infer relations between entities in a multitask approach. Our contribution is two-fold: a neural-symbolic methodology leverages the resolution of relational inference in large graphs, and we also demonstrate that such neural-symbolic model is shown more effective than path-based approaches",

    "abstract": "We introduce a simulated digital model that learns a person's baseline blood health over time. Using an adaptive learning algorithm, the model provides a risk assessment score that compares an individual's chronological age with an estimation of biological age based on common immune-relevant markers used in current clinical practice. We demonstrate its efficacy on real and synthetic data from medically relevant cases, extreme cases, and empirical blood cell count data from 100K data records in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (CDC NHANES) that spans 13 years. We find that the score is informative in distinguishing healthy individuals from those with diseases, both self-reported and as manifested via abnormal blood test results, providing an entry-level score for patient triaging. The risk assessment score is not a machine learning black-box approach but can interact with ML and DL approaches to help guide, control the attention given to specific features, and assign proper explainable weight to an otherwise transparent adaptive learning algorithm. This approach may allow fast and scalable deployment to personalised, sensitive, and predictive derivative indexes within digital medicine, without the need for a new test, assay, or prospective sampling, unlike other biological ageing-related scores and methods. It demonstrates the potential of clinical informatics and deep medicine in digital healthcare as drivers of innovation in preventive patient care.",

    "abstract": "Various attempts towards combination of symbolic and neural networking have been tried Some of those attempts are focused on representation of rules using neural networks and other are concerned with extraction of rules from neural nets. Some others use neuroevolutions to represent nets that can finally be used as rule-based system. In this paper we present an outline scheme for representation of the General Rule Structure (GRS) with neural networks (neurosymbolic integration). GRS has a structure that can be applied in real time systems. A GRSNL network to represent GRS is proposed Because the nature of GRS is a little bit complex despite its high capabilities, a parallel scheme to train independent nets is proposed This scheme will expedite the process of training.",

    "abstract": "The fixpoint completion fix(P) of a normal logic program P is a program transformation such that the stable models of P are exactly the models of the Clark completion of fix(P). This is well-known and was studied by Dung and Kanchanasut (1989). The correspondence, however, goes much further: The Gelfond-Lifschitz operator of P coincides with the immediate consequence operator of fix(P), as shown by Wendt (2002), and even carries over to standard operators used for characterizing the well-founded and the Kripke-Kleene semantics. We will apply this knowledge to the study of the stable semantics, and this will allow us to almost effortlessly derive new results concerning fixed-point and metric-based semantics, and neural-symbolic integration.",

We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of dalpiciclib plus letrozole/anastrozole (non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor [NSAI]) compared with abemaciclib plus NSAI as a first-line treatment for HR+/HER2- ABC in China. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model with three health states to evaluate health and economic outcomes of first-line treatment with dalpiciclib plus NSAI and abemaciclib plus NSAI for HR+/HER2- ABC. Efficacy data was obtained from MONARCH3 and DAWNA-2 trials. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: Compared with abemaciclib plus NSAI, dalpiciclib plus NSAI resulted in 4.27 additional QALYs, with an ICER of 14827.4/QALY. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times gross domestic product per capita in China for 2023 (37721.5/QALY), the cost-effectiveness probability of dalpiciclib plus NSAI was 77.42%. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of Chinese payers, dalpiciclib plus NSAI appears to be a cost-effective strategy compared with abemaciclib plus NSAI for the first-line treatment of patients with HR+/HER2- ABC in China. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: MONARCH3, www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier is NCT02246621 and DAWNA-2, www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier is NCT03966898.",

This interdisciplinary area integrates scene understanding, language processing, and policy learning to bridge the gap between human instructions and robotic actions. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically explore recent advancements in language-conditioned robotic manipulation. We categorize existing methods into language-conditioned reward shaping, language-conditioned policy learning, neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence, and the utilization of foundational models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we analyze state-of-the-art techniques concerning semantic information extraction, environment and evaluation, auxiliary tasks, and task representation strategies. By conducting a comparative analysis, we highlight the strengths and limitations of current approaches in bridging language instructions with robot actions. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future research directions, focusing on potentially enhancing generalization capabilities and addressing safety issues in language-conditioned robot manipulators.",

    "author": "Hooshyar, Danial",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neural and symbolic architectures are key techniques in AI for learner modelling, enhancing adaptive educational services. Symbolic models offer explanation and reasoning for decisions but require significant human effort. On the other hand, neural architectures demand less human input and yield better predictions, yet lack interpretability. Given the high-risk nature of education and that incorrectly tailored support can negatively affect learning outcomes, the integration of neural and symbolic architectures becomes crucial. This research proposes a novel neural-symbolic AI approach for temporal learner modelling, called TemporaLM, that leverages unsupervised deep neural networks (i.e., autoencoders enriched with symbolic educational knowledge) and dynamic Bayesian networks for learners' knowledge tracing over time. The approach employs a dynamic Bayesian network for temporal knowledge tracking in learners' computational thinking and employs a knowledge-based autoencoder to enhance predictive performance through synthetic data augmentation. Our findings from both cross-validation and practical application demonstrate that the TemporaLM approach, trained on the neural-symbolic AI augmented dataset, achieves better generalizability, yielding an accuracy of 85% and an F1 score of 87%. This surpasses the dynamic Bayesian network trained solely on original and autoencoder-augmented data. Notably, by leveraging the transformed dataset for model training, improvements of up to 8% in F1 score and 5% in accuracy were achieved compared to the original dataset, observed in both cross-validation and application stages. The augmented prediction capabilities, coupled with interpretable knowledge tracing, cultivate trust among educators and learners in data-driven decisions. These findings underline the potential of neural-symbolic family of AI to improve limitation of existing (symbolic) AI methods in education, advancing AI's potential in education and enabling trustworthy and interpretable applications.",

    "author": "Hooshyar, Danial and Roger, Azevedo and Yeongwook, Yang",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have proven to be among the most important artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in educational applications, providing adaptive educational services. However, their educational potential is limited in practice due to challenges such as the following: (i) the difficulties in incorporating symbolic educational knowledge (e.g., causal relationships and practitioners' knowledge) in their development, (ii) a propensity to learn and reflect biases, and (iii) a lack of interpretability. As education is classified as a `high-risk' domain under recent regulatory frameworks like the EU AI Act-highlighting its influence on individual futures and discrimination risks-integrating educational insights into ANNs is essential. This ensures that AI applications adhere to essential educational restrictions and provide interpretable predictions. This research introduces NSAI, a neural-symbolic AI approach that integrates neural networks with knowledge representation and symbolic reasoning. It injects and extracts educational knowledge into and from deep neural networks to model learners' computational thinking, aiming to enhance personalized learning and develop computational thinking skills. Our findings revealed that the NSAI approach demonstrates better generalizability compared to deep neural networks trained on both original training data and data enriched by SMOTE and autoencoder methods. More importantly, we found that, unlike traditional deep neural networks, which mainly relied on spurious correlations in their predictions, the NSAI approach prioritizes the development of robust representations that accurately capture causal relationships between inputs and outputs. This focus significantly reduces the reinforcement of biases and prevents misleading correlations in the models. Furthermore, our research showed that the NSAI approach enables the extraction of rules from the trained network, facilitating interpretation and reasoning during the path to predictions, as well as refining the initial educational knowledge. These findings imply that neural-symbolic AI not only overcomes the limitations of ANNs in education but also holds broader potential for transforming educational practices and outcomes through trustworthy and interpretable applications.",

This is the final preplanned analysis of invasive disease-free survival (iDFS). Patients and methods: Premenopausal/postmenopausal women and men were randomized 1 : 1 to ribociclib (n = 2549; 400 mg/day, 3 weeks on/1 week off for 36 months) plus NSAI (letrozole 2.5 mg/day or anastrozole 1 mg/day for 60 months) or NSAI alone (n = 2552). Men and premenopausal women also received goserelin (3.6 mg once every 28 days). Patients had anatomical stage IIA (N0 with additional risk factors or N1), IIB, or III disease. The primary endpoint was iDFS. Secondary efficacy endpoints were recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant DFS, and overall survival. This final iDFS analysis was planned after w500 events. Results: At data cut-off (21 July 2023), ribociclib was stopped for 1996 patients (78.3%); 1091 (42.8%) completed 3 years of ribociclib, and ribociclib treatment was ongoing for 528 (20.7%). Median follow-up for iDFS was 33.3 months. Overall, 226 and 283 iDFS events occurred with ribociclib plus NSAI versus NSAI alone, respectively. Ribociclib plus NSAI demonstrated significant iDFS benefit over NSAI alone [ hazard ratio 0.749, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.628-0.892; P = 0.0012]. The 3-year iDFS rates were 90.7% (95% CI 89.3% to 91.8%) versus 87.6% (95% CI 86.1% to 88.9%). A consistent benefit was observed across prespecified subgroups, including stage (II/III) and nodal status (positive/negative). Distant DFS and RFS favored ribociclib plus NSAI. Overall survival data were immature. No new safety signals were observed. Conclusions: With longer follow-up and most patients off ribociclib, NATALEE continues to demonstrate iDFS benefit with ribociclib plus NSAI over NSAI alone in the overall population and across key subgroups. Observed adverse events remained stable.",

    "abstract": "Assessing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) during drug development is essential for ensuring the safety of new compounds. The blockade of the Ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel plays a critical role in cardiac repolarization. Computational predictions of hERG inhibition can help foresee drug safety, but current data-driven approaches have limitations. Therefore, a new paradigm that bridges the gap between data and knowledge offers an alternative for advancing precision pharmacogenomics in assessing hERG cardiotoxicity. This study aims to develop a reasoning-based, in silico, robust model for predicting drug-induced hERG inhibition, facilitating new drug development by reducing time and cost, supporting downstream in vitro and in vivo testing. In this study, we constructed a new cohort, UnihERG\\_{D}{B}{,} by sourcing data from ChEMBL, PubChem, BindingDB, GTP, hERG Karim's, and hERG Blocker's bioactivity databases. The final dataset comprises 20,409 structures represented as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System), labeled as hERG blockers (IC50 < 10 uM) or non-hERG blockers (IC50 >= 10 uM). Molecular features were extracted using Morgan and CDK fingerprints. Furthermore, we explored embedding feature computation using cutting-edge Large Language Models, including NVIDIA MegaMolBART, LLaMA 3.2, Gemini, and DeepSeek. Finally, we utilized the Logic Tensor Network (LTN), an advanced AI framework, to train and develop the hERG predictive model. Model performance was evaluated using two benchmarks: External Test-1 and hERG-70. The Logic Tensor Network (LTN) outperformed several models, including CardioTox, M-PNN, DeepHIT, CardPred, OCHEM Predictor II, Pred-hERG 4.2, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. On the External Test-1 dataset, LTN achieved an accuracy of 0.931, a specificity of 0.928, and a sensitivity of 0.933. Furthermore, on the hERG-70 benchmark, LTN achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 0.827, a specificity (SPE) of 0.890, and a correct classification rate (CCR) of 0.833. Overall, the Neuro-Symbolic AI approach sets a new standard for hERG-related cardiotoxicity assessment, yielding competitive results with current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, and highlights its potential for advancing precision pharmacogenomics in drug discovery and development (GitHub).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",

    "abstract": "The lack of interpretability in the field of medical image analysis has significant ethical and legal implications. Existing interpretable methods in this domain encounter several challenges, including dependency on specific models, difficulties in understanding and visualization, as well as issues related to efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Med-MICN (Medical Multi-dimensional Interpretable Concept Network). Med-MICN provides interpretability alignment for various angles, including neural symbolic reasoning, concept semantics, and saliency maps, which are superior to current interpretable methods. Its advantages include high prediction accuracy, interpretability across multiple dimensions, and automation through an end-to-end concept labeling process that reduces the need for extensive human training effort when working with new datasets. To demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of Med-MICN, we apply it to four benchmark datasets and compare it with baselines. The results clearly demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our Med-MICN.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "In order to be trusted by humans, Artificial Intelligence agents should be able to describe rationales behind their decisions. One such application is human action recognition in critical or sensitive scenarios, where trustworthy and explainable action recognizers are expected. For example, reliable pedestrian action recognition is essential for self-driving cars and explanations for real-time decision making are critical for investigations if an accident happens. In this regard, learning-based approaches, despite their popularity and accuracy, are disadvantageous due to their limited interpretability. This paper presents a novel neuro-symbolic approach that recognizes actions from videos with human-understandable explanations. Specifically, we first propose to represent videos symbolically by qualitative spatial relations between objects called qualitative spatial object relation chains. We further develop a neural saliency estimator to capture the correlation between such object relation chains and the occurrence of actions. Given an unseen video, this neural saliency estimator is able to tell which object relation chains are more important for the action recognized. We evaluate our approach on two real-life video datasets, with respect to recognition accuracy and the quality of generated action explanations. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior performance on both aspects to previous symbolic approaches, thus facilitating trustworthy intelligent decision making. Our approach can be used to augment state-of-the-art learning approaches with explainability.",

    "abstract": "A cognitive architecture aimed at cumulative learning must provide the necessary information and control structures to allow agents to learn incrementally and autonomously from their experience. This involves managing an agent's goals as well as continuously relating sensory information to these in its perception-cognition information stack. The more varied the environment of a learning agent is, the more general and flexible must be these mechanisms to handle a wider variety of relevant patterns, tasks, and goal structures. While many researchers agree that information at different levels of abstraction likely differs in its makeup and structure and processing mechanisms, agreement on the particulars of such differences is not generally shared in the research community. A binary processing architecture (often referred to as System-1 and System-2) has been proposed as a model of cognitive processing for low- and high-level information, respectively. We posit that cognition is not binary in this way and that knowledge at any level of abstraction involves what we refer to as neurosymbolic information, meaning that data at both high and low levels must contain both symbolic and subsymbolic information. Further, we argue that the main differentiating factor between the processing of high and low levels of data abstraction can be largely attributed to the nature of the involved attention mechanisms. We describe the key arguments behind this view and review relevant evidence from the literature.",

    "abstract": "Introduction In recent years there has been an increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases and therefore an increased number of patients with antiplatelet therapy, which led to bleeding complications. Aim. Evaluation of potential hemorrhagic lesions of the upper digestive tract in patients receiving long-term antiplatelet treatment (over 6 months). Materials and Methods We performed a retrospective descriptive study which included all patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding (hematemesis or melena) who were admitted to the Emergency County Hospital ``St. Spiridon '' Gastroenterology and Hepatology Center Iasi and were receiving chronic antiplatelet treatment during the period of 1 January to 31 December 2018. Results From a total of 850 cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage), 45 cases (5.29%) were receiving antiplatelet treatment. The average age was 71 years, with male predominance (59%) and a ratio of 1.3. The diseases for which they received antiplatelet therapy were: 72% cardiovascular diseases and 18% strokes. 38 (4.47%) were smokes and chronic alcohol consumption was encountered in 29 (3.41%) patients. 26 (57.7%) of patients received intermittent treatment with NSAI and 37 (82.2%) patients had associated antiplatelet therapy with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage type Forrest II was detected in 78% of patients. The main endoscopic lesions found in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy were the duodenal bulbar ulcers in 23 cases (51.1%), followed by acute hemorrhagic gastritis in 8 cases (17.7%), angiodysplasia in 2 cases (4.44%), gastric cancer in 4 cases (8.88%), Mallory-Weiss syndrome in 5 patients (11.1%) and esophageal ulcer in 3 patients (6.66%). Conclusions Despite the widespread use of antiplatelet therapy and its beneficial effects for elderly patients, the long-term use is encumbered by digestive complications requiring gastroenterological supervision and association of proton pump inhibitors during treatment.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Diet plays a crucial role in managing chronic conditions and overall well-being. As people become more selective about their food choices, finding recipes that meet dietary needs is important. Ingredient substitution is key to adapting recipes for dietary restrictions, allergies, and availability constraints. However, identifying suitable substitutions is challenging as it requires analyzing the flavor, functionality, and health suitability of ingredients. With the advancement of AI, researchers have explored computational approaches to address ingredient substitution. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the research in this area, focusing on five key aspects: (i) datasets and data sources used to support ingredient substitution research; (ii) techniques and approaches applied to solve substitution problems (iii) contextual information of ingredients considered, such as nutritional content, flavor, and pairing potential; (iv) applications for which substitution models have been developed, including dietary restrictions, constraints, and missing ingredients; (v) safety and transparency of substitution models, focusing on user trust and health concerns. The survey also highlights promising directions for future research, such as integrating neuro-symbolic techniques for deep learning and utilizing knowledge graphs for improved reasoning, aiming to guide advancements in food computation and ingredient substitution.",

    "abstract": "This paper compares Julia reduction and hyperbolic reduction with the aim of finding equivalent binary forms with minimal coefficients. We demonstrate that hyperbolic reduction generally outperforms Julia reduction, particularly in the cases of sextics and decimics, though neither method guarantees achieving the minimal form. We further propose an additional shift and scaling to approximate the minimal form more closely. Finally, we introduce a machine learning framework to identify optimal transformations that minimize the heights of binary forms. This study provides new insights into the geometry and algebra of binary forms and highlights the potential of AI in advancing symbolic computation and reduction techniques. The findings, supported by extensive computational experiments, lay the groundwork for hybrid approaches that integrate traditional reduction methods with data-driven techniques.",

We cover representative neuro-symbolic commonsense methods that leverage this commonsense knowledge to reason over questions and stories. The range of reasoning mechanisms includes procedural reasoning, reasoning by analogy, and reasoning by imagination.

    "abstract": "The introduction of the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NS-AI) anastrozole as an alternative to tamoxifen for adjuvant therapy of women with resected hormone receptor-positive breast cancer has added a management category into which patients presenting with metastatic disease can be placed. There are now essentially three such categories: (a) tamoxifen sensitive (no prior AI); (b) tamoxifen resistant (no prior AI); and (c) NS-AI resistant (no prior tamoxifen). Well-conducted Phase III trials provide evidence for choosing first-line therapy for advanced disease in categories a and b. In tamoxifen-sensitive patients, one can choose either NS-AI, anastrozole, or letrozole. In tamoxifen-resistant patients, one can choose either of the NS-AIs, the steroidal AI exemestane, or the estrogen receptor down-regulator fulvestrant. The situation is quite different for patients in category c. There are no Phase III trials of agents in patients who have experienced disease progression on a NS-AI. Phase II data are available for exemestane and high-dose estrogens, and retrospective data are available for tamoxifen and fulvestrant. Additional clinical trials are needed to determine an optimal sequencing strategy.",

    "abstract": "Flip through any book or listen to any song lyrics, and you will come across pronouns that, in certain cases, can hinder meaning comprehension, especially for machines. As the role of having cognitive machines becomes pervasive in our lives, numerous systems have been developed to resolve pronouns under various challenges. Commensurate with this, it is believed that having systems able to disambiguate pronouns in sentences will help towards the endowment of machines with commonsense and reasoning abilities like those found in humans. However, one problem these systems face with modern English is the lack of gender pronouns, where people try to alternate by using masculine, feminine, or plural to avoid the whole issue. Since humanity aims to the building of systems in the full-bodied sense we usually reserve for people, what happens when pronouns in written text, like plural or epicene ones, refer to unspecified entities whose gender is not necessarily known? Wouldn't that put extra barriers to existing coreference resolution systems? Towards answering those questions, through the implementation of a neural-symbolic system that utilizes the best of both worlds, we are employing PronounFlow, a system that reads any English sentence with pronouns and entities, identifies which of them are not tied to each other, and makes suggestions on which to use to avoid biases. Undertaken experiments show that PronounFlow not only alternates pronouns in sentences based on the collective human knowledge around us but also considerably helps coreference resolution systems with the pronoun disambiguation process.",

    "author": "Islam, Mohammad Maminur and Somdeb, Sarkhel and Deepak, Venugopal",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic learning, where deep networks are combined with symbolic knowledge can help regularize the model and control overfitting. In particular, for applications where data instances are not independent, domain knowledge can be used to specify relational dependencies which may be hard to infer purely from the data. Symbolic Al models such as Markov Logic networks (MLNs) which are based on first -order logic are designed to represent and reason with uncertain background knowledge. However learning and inference algorithms in such models is known to he slow and inaccurate. In this paper, we develop a novel model that combines the best of both worlds, namely, the scalable learning capabilities of DNNs and symbolic knowledge specified in MLNs. To do this, we infer symmetries in the data based on the relational knowledge encoded in an MLN knowledge base and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn kernels combining symmetrical variables. However, by doing this, we are forced to split the relational data into independent instances for CNN training which may result is a loss of relational dependencies adding noise/uncertainty to the learned model. Therefore, instead of a single model, we learn a distribution over the model parameters. Our experiments illustrate that our model outperforms purely-MLN or purely-DNN based models in several different problem domains.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Despite various pain management methods, chronic pain is still a challenging issue after thoracotomy. This retrospective study was designed to determine the possible factors affecting the development of chronic pain following open thoracotomy. METHODS: The study included patients who underwent elective open thoracotomy at Ankara University İbni Sina Hospital, between 01.01.2016 and 31.12.2020. The medical files and electronic records of the patients were scanned from the system. Patient history, analgesic methods, and surgical details were recorded. The need for and usage analgesic drugs after the surgery were also recorded. RESULTS: A total of 229 patients who underwent thoracotomy were included in the study, and 83 (36.2%) patients had chronic pain. Duration of surgery, doses of remifentanil, fentanyl or NSAI drugs, duration or number of chest tubes (more than 4 days, or more than 2 tubes), diabetes, or PCEA usage were found as variables affecting pain. Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and Random Forest methods were used to evaluate the prediction performances. According to the model created with logistic regression, the rate of the correct classification was 90.8%. The duration of surgery, remifentanil administration, chest tube for more than 4 days, and diabetes were found to be risk factors for developing chronic pain. Fentanyl bolus, PCEA-bupivacaine, and NSAID bolus were determined as preventive factors. CONCLUSION: A careful analysis of risk factors should be performed for each patient to prevent chronic pain after thoracotomy, and preemptive effective analgesia methods should be performed.",

    "abstract": "Resource-constrained edge deployments demand AI solutions that balance high performance with stringent compute, memory, and energy limitations. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the primary strategies for accelerating deep learning models under such constraints. First, we examine model compression techniques-pruning, quantization, tensor decomposition, and knowledge distillation-that streamline large models into smaller, faster, and more efficient variants. Next, we explore Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a class of automated methods that discover architectures inherently optimized for particular tasks and hardware budgets. We then discuss compiler and deployment frameworks, such as TVM, TensorRT, and OpenVINO, which provide hardware-tailored optimizations at inference time. By integrating these three pillars into unified pipelines, practitioners can achieve multi-objective goals, including latency reduction, memory savings, and energy efficiency-all while maintaining competitive accuracy. We also highlight emerging frontiers in hierarchical NAS, neurosymbolic approaches, and advanced distillation tailored to large language models, underscoring open challenges like pre-training pruning for massive networks. Our survey offers practical insights, identifies current research gaps, and outlines promising directions for building scalable, platform-independent frameworks to accelerate deep learning models at the edge.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge about space and time is necessary to solve problems in the physical world: An AI agent situated in the physical world and interacting with objects often needs to reason about positions of and relations between objects; and as soon as the agent plans its actions to solve a task, it needs to consider the temporal aspect (e.g., what actions to perform over time). Spatio-temporal knowledge, however, is required beyond interacting with the physical world, and is also often transferred to the abstract world of concepts through analogies and metaphors (e.g., a threat that is hanging over our heads ). As spatial and temporal reasoning is ubiquitous, different attempts have been made to integrate this into AI systems. In the area of knowledge representation, spatial and temporal reasoning has been largely limited to modeling objects and relations and developing reasoning methods to verify statements about objects and relations. On the other hand, neural network researchers have tried to teach models to learn spatial relations from data with limited reasoning capabilities. Bridging the gap between these two approaches in a mutually beneficial way could allow us to tackle many complex real-world problems, such as natural language processing, visual question answering, and semantic image segmentation. In this chapter, we view this integration problem from the perspective of Neuro-Symbolic AI. Specifically, we propose a synergy between logical reasoning and machine learning that will be grounded on spatial and temporal knowledge. Describing some successful applications, remaining challenges, and evaluation datasets pertaining to this direction is the main topic of this contribution.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning about graphs, and learning from graph data is a field of artificial intelligence that has recently received much attention in the machine learning areas of graph representation learning and graph neural networks. Graphs are also the underlying structures of interest in a wide range of more traditional fields ranging from logic-oriented knowledge representation and reasoning to graph kernels and statistical relational learning. In this review we outline a broad map and inventory of the field of learning and reasoning with graphs that spans the spectrum from reasoning in the form of logical deduction to learning node embeddings. To obtain a unified perspective on such a diverse landscape we introduce a simple and general semantic concept of a model that covers logic knowledge bases, graph neural networks, kernel support vector machines, and many other types of frameworks. Still at a high semantic level, we survey common strategies for model specification using probabilistic factorization and standard feature construction techniques. Based on this semantic foundation we introduce a taxonomy of reasoning tasks that casts problems ranging from transductive link prediction to asymptotic analysis of random graph models as queries of different complexities for a given model. Similarly, we express learning in different frameworks and settings in terms of a common statistical maximum likelihood principle. Overall, this review aims to provide a coherent conceptual framework that provides a basis for further theoretical analyses of respective strengths and limitations of different approaches to handling graph data, and that facilitates combination and integration of different modeling paradigms.",

    "author": "de Miguel-Rodriguez, Jaime and Fernando, Sancho-Caparrini",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neural-symbolic approaches to machine learning incorporate the advantages from both connectionist and symbolic methods. Typically, these models employ a first module based on a neural architecture to extract features from complex data. Then, these features are processed as symbols by a symbolic engine that provides reasoning, concept structures, composability, better generalization and out-of-distribution learning among other possibilities. However, neural approaches to the grounding of symbols in sensory data, albeit powerful, still require heavy training and tedious labeling for the most part. This paper presents a new symbolic-only method for the generation of hierarchical concept structures from complex spatial sensory data. The approach is based on Bateson's notion of difference as the key to the genesis of an idea or a concept. Following his suggestion, the model extracts atomic features from raw data by computing elemental sequential comparisons in a stream of multivariate numerical values. Higher-level constructs are built from these features by subjecting them to further comparisons in a recursive process. At any stage in the recursion, a concept structure may be obtained from these constructs and features by means of Formal Concept Analysis. Results show that the model is able to produce fairly rich yet human-readable conceptual representations without training. Additionally, the concept structures obtained through the model (i) present high composability, which potentially enables the generation of 'unseen' concepts, (ii) allow formal reasoning, and (iii) have inherent abilities for generalization and out-of-distribution learning. Consequently, this method may offer an interesting angle to current neural-symbolic research. Future work is required to develop a training methodology so that the model can be tested against a larger dataset.",

    "abstract": "Commonsense knowledge-graphs (CKGs) are important resources towards building machines that can 'reason' on text or environmental inputs and make inferences beyond perception. While current CKGs encode world knowledge for a large number of concepts and have been effectively utilized for incorporating commonsense in neural models, they primarily encode declarative or single-condition inferential knowledge and assume all conceptual beliefs to have the same likelihood. Further, these CKGs utilize a limited set of relations shared across concepts and lack a coherent knowledge organization structure resulting in redundancies as well as sparsity across the larger knowledge graph. Consequently, today's CKGs, while useful for a first level of reasoning, do not adequately capture deeper human-level commonsense inferences which can be more nuanced and influenced by multiple contextual or situational factors. Accordingly, in this work, we study how commonsense knowledge can be better represented by - (i) utilizing a probabilistic logic representation scheme to model composite inferential knowledge and represent conceptual beliefs with varying likelihoods and (ii) incorporating a hierarchical conceptual ontology to identify salient concept-relevant relations and organize beliefs at different conceptual levels. Our resulting knowledge representation framework can encode a wider variety of world knowledge and represent beliefs flexibly using grounded concepts as well as free-text phrases. As a result, the framework can be utilized as both a traditional free-text knowledge graph and a grounded logic-based inference system more suitable for neuro-symbolic applications. We describe how we extend the PrimeNet knowledge base with our framework through crowd-sourcing and expert-annotation, and demonstrate its application for more interpretable passage-based semantic parsing and question answering.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate the need and potential of systematically integrated vision and semantics solutions for visual sensemaking in the backdrop of autonomous driving. A general neurosymbolic method for online visual sensemaking using answer set programming (ASP) is systematically formalised and fully implemented. The method integrates state of the art in visual computing, and is developed as a modular framework that is generally usable within hybrid architectures for realtime perception and control. We evaluate and demonstrate with community established benchmarks KITTIMOD, MOT-2017, and MOT-2020. As use-case, we focus on the significance of human-centred visual sensemaking - e.g., involving semantic representation and explainability, question-answering, commonsense interpolation - in safety-critical autonomous driving situations. The developed neurosymbolic framework is domain-independent, with the case of autonomous driving designed to serve as an exemplar for online visual sensemaking in diverse cognitive interaction settings in the backdrop of select human-centred AI technology design considerations.

Several candidate gene polymorphisms have been associated with responses to biologic therapies and nbDMARDs; however, replication and validation of these variants in large prospective psoriatic arthritis cohorts are required before translating these to clinical practice. In this review, we discuss the advances made in pharmacogenetics of treatment response in psoriatic arthritis to date, with focus on biologic therapies approved for use, nbDMARDs and NSAI Ds, as well as outline emerging methodologies to obtain data that will help inform a future precision medicine approach in this condition.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current standard of care for patients with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer (EBC) includes adjuvant endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or tamoxifen (TAM). We present a trial-level meta-analysis on efficacy of AI vs TAM in patients with HR+/HER2- EBC. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using key medical literature databases (eg, PubMed; inception to October 2023) and data from conferences (to December 2023). Phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that had ≥80 % of patients with HR+/HER2- EBC (or available subgroup data) and reported a disease-free survival (DFS) hazard ratio for AI vs TAM were included in the meta-analysis, regardless of menopausal status and ovarian function suppression (OFS) use. The generic invariance method was used to calculate a pooled effect estimate of DFS hazard ratios and 95 % CIs. A base-case analysis (all RCTs) and scenario analyses for NSAI-only, premenopausal, and postmenopausal RCTs were conducted. RESULTS: Five RCTs were identified for inclusion in the meta-analysis. In the base-case analysis, DFS significantly favored AI ± OFS vs TAM ± OFS (pooled hazard ratio, 0.68; 95 % CI, 0.61-0.76; P < .0001). Results from scenario analyses were consistent with the base case; NSAI-only (pooled hazard ratio, 0.68; 95 % CI, 0.59-0.78; P < .0001), premenopausal (pooled hazard ratio, 0.65; 95 % CI, 0.56-0.76; P < .0001), and postmenopausal (pooled hazard ratio, 0.72; 95 % CI, 0.61-0.86; P = .001) RCTs favored AI ± OFS over TAM ± OFS. CONCLUSIONS: This trial-level meta-analysis demonstrated a significant DFS benefit with AI vs TAM for patients with HR+/HER2- EBC, which was more pronounced in premenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "Issue/problem Potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIP) for the elderly constitute a major issue in the quality of ambulatory care. In France, people aged 80 years or older use on average five drugs per day. This polypharmacy is justified in most cases by multimorbidity but it increases the risk of adverse events. Description of the problem In order to optimize general practitioners’ (GPs) prescribing practices for the elderly, a project involving the Southeastern Health Regional Observatory (ORS Paca), the Regional Medical Department of Health Insurance Fund (DRSM Paca-Corse) and the Regional Union of Private Practitioners (URPS-ML Paca) was conducted in 2014-2016. Its main objective was to set up a regional mapping tool giving GPs access to drug prescriptions indicators for the elderly in their practice area. Results Based on national guidelines and advice of experts in the field, we calculated 7 different indicators of potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIPs) for people aged 65 years or older, using drug reimbursement data from the Health Insurance Fund. Those indicators were calculated among patient lists of GPs and covered prescriptions of benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs, new oral anticoagulants, proton pump inhibitors, antiplatelet therapy... PIPs’ prevalence were calculated among GPs’ lists of patients. PIPs prevalence differed between drugs type, GPs and territories: for example, the age standardized prevalence of long-term treatment with NSAI drugs varied in 2014 from 2 to 15% between municipalities and from 0 to 14% in 2017. Lessons These results allowed to identify priority areas for intervention, in which continuous medical education sessions with an individual feedback to GPs on their own indicators were implemented, to improve prescribing practices. Key messages A substantial proportion of elderly people receive PIPs. Medico-administrative databases can be used to produce indicators of prescription practices to be used to guide public health interventions.",

While widely used in reinforcement learning, they lack the structured, adaptive representations that even young children intuitively develop.

We highlight six key research areas - physics-informed learning, neurosymbolic learning, continual learning, causal inference, human-in-the-loop AI, and responsible AI - as essential for enabling true reasoning in AI. By integrating statistical learning with advances in these areas, AI can evolve from pattern recognition to genuine understanding, adaptation and reasoning capabilities.",

We describe how this methodology can be applied to the discovery of climate tipping points and, in particular, the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We show how this methodology is able to predict AMOC collapse with a high degree of accuracy using a surrogate climate model for ocean interaction. We also show preliminary results of neuro-symbolic method performance when translating between natural language questions and symbolically learned representations. Our AI methodology shows promising early results, potentially enabling faster climate tipping point related research that would otherwise be computationally infeasible.",

However, patients who suffer from disease progression while receiving a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) have a very poor prognosis with standard endocrine therapy alone. Recently, based onthe results of the BOLERO 2 trial, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor everolimus, combined with exemestane, a steroidal aromatase inhibitor, has been approved in Europe and the US for patients suffering from ER positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer previously treated by a NSAI. The median progression-free survival (PFS) increased from 3.2 to 7.8 months in patients receiving everolimus and exemestane compared to placebo and exemestane. The magnitude of benefit was consistent in all pre-specified subgroups. Side effects were manageable and the quality of life was at least maintained. Everolimus has also beenrecently studied in HER2 positive locally advanced or metastatic disease in heavily pretreated patients (BOLERO 3 trial). This trial met its primary endpoint. The median PFS was increased in patients receiving trastuzumab, vinorelbine and everolimus compared to patients receiving trastuzumab, vinorelbine and placebo. We review pharmacological data and side effects of the drug. We also review the most important clinical trials leading to reimbursement of everolimus in metastatic breast cancer.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This paper describes the core concepts and challenges in developing Trinity - a high-assurance neuro-symbolic approach to trustworthy and resilient machine learning for applications in open-world, contested, and rapidly-evolving environments. The two central concepts in Trinity are a neuro-symbolic factored world model that identifies entities, activities, and complex events, and the notion of surprise against this world model that is used for self-adaptation and learning, as well as runtime assurance. The world model is not derived purely as a bottom-up inference from sensors treating each observation as independent uncorrelated input; instead, we iteratively interleave bottom-up inference (conditioned on context) with top-down predictions and context identification using a three-layered hierarchical predictive processing (HPP) stack. Thus, the neuro-symbolic inference in Trinity is bidirectional - learning-based bottom-up pull that is uncertainty-driven and reasoning-based symbolic top-down push that is decision-driven. The progressively symbolic higher layers capture a larger context than the bottom layers finally culminating in the highest layer implemented using large language models. Any surprise arising from the mismatch between the top-down prediction and the bottom-up inference is used for the continual adaptation of Trinity. The inference in Trinity produces a factored temporal world model as the result of perception. The predictions are accompanied by a quantitative measure of surprise from the 3-layered HPP stack. This surprise corresponds to the confidence of the model in its current inference. The continuous monitoring and adaptation accompanied by risk analysis make Trinity robust to semantic adversarial perturbations and more efficiently generalizable to novelties. The hierarchical nature of Trinity also enables adaptation of the architecture to the available compute resources.",

    "author": "Ji, Pengliang and Junchen, Liu",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Evaluation of generative foundation models (GenFMs) for text-to-visual tasks has been enhanced by automatic alignment metrics such as CLIPScore, complementing human feedback. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from a severe long-tail effect, where the balance between token count and semantic validity in the initial step, hinders the accurate evaluation of advanced aspects such as composition. We analyze this drawback and attribute it to a lack of symbolic reasoning attention, while GenFMs demonstrate strong discriminative abilities in handling symbolism. To this end, we propose a pioneering paradigm for evaluating GenFMs' text-to-visual (T2V) generation using neurosymbolic thinking to mitigate the long-tail effect. By explicitly embedding Mixture-of-experts (MoE) Large Vision Models (LVMs), we introduce symbolic-level understanding while maintaining the strong neuro-level reasoning capability. Through the fusion of semantic and compositional knowledge at the neuro-to-symbolic level, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art T2V evaluation methods, exhibiting stronger compositional reasoning ability on Winoground and better alignment with human judgment. We also demonstrate our impressive effectiveness on diverse tasks, including text-to-3D and text-to-video. To further advance the T2V evaluation of GenFMs, we propose a challenging benchmark that includes richer and more diverse compositional and semantic information compared to Winoground. Overall, our work opens a new direction for neuro-to-symbolic visio-linguistic evaluation of GenFMs and aims to drive further progress in the field.",

    "abstract": "Deep code generation is a topic of deep learning for software engineering (DL4SE), which adopts neural models to generate code for the intended functions. Since end-to-end neural methods lack domain knowledge and software hierarchy awareness, they tend to perform poorly w.r.t project-level tasks. To systematically explore the potential improvements of code generation, we let it participate in the whole top-down development from \\emph expressibles to \\emph executables , which is possible in limited scopes. In the process, it benefits from massive samples, features, and knowledge. As the foundation, we suggest building a taxonomy on code data, namely code taxonomy, leveraging the categorization of code information. Moreover, we introduce a three-layer semantic pyramid (SP) to associate text data and code data. It identifies the information of different abstraction levels, and thus introduces the domain knowledge on development and reveals the hierarchy of software. Furthermore, we propose a semantic pyramid framework (SPF) as the approach, focusing on software of high modularity and low complexity. SPF divides the code generation process into stages and reserves spots for potential interactions. In addition, we conceived preliminary applications in software development to confirm the neuro-symbolic framework.",

In addition, NSAI Ds have anticancer activity and may reduce the risk and mortality of several cancers. However, the association between postoperative NSAIDs and the clinical outcome of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with fever after surgery is not fully understood. We performed a retrospective study of NSCLC patients who underwent surgery between July 2011 and June 2012, aiming to evaluate the effect of postoperative NSAIDs on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Differences in clinical data between the postoperative NSAIDs group and non-NSAIDs groups were analyzed by Chi-square tests. Kaplan-Meier curves method and Cox regression analysis were conducted for survival analysis. The primary and secondary endpoints were OS and PFS, respectively. This retrospective study included 347 NSCLC patients. There were no significant differences in the clinical characteristics between the NSAI Ds group and non-NSAIDs group except for age (P =.024) and differential degree (P =.040) Administration of postoperative NSAIDs was related to longer OS (hazards ratio [ HR] 0.528, 95% confidence interval [ CI] 0.278-0.884, P=.006) and longer PFS (HR 0.557, 95% CI 0.317-0.841. P =.002) in the multivariate Cox regression model. Subgroup analysis showed statistically significant differences in elderly individuals, male subjects, low smoking index. poor differentiation. and non-adenocarcinoma subgroups. respectively. In conclusion, the administration of postoperative NSAIDs was related to longer OS and PFS in NSCLC patients with postoperative fever.",

    "abstract": "When answering questions about an image, it not only needs knowing what - understanding the fine-grained contents (e.g., objects, relationships) in the image, but also telling why - reasoning over grounding visual cues to derive the answer for a question. Over the last few years, we have seen significant progress on visual question answering. Though impressive as the accuracy grows, it still lags behind to get knowing whether these models are undertaking grounding visual reasoning or just leveraging spurious correlations in the training data. Recently, a number of works have attempted to answer this question from perspectives such as grounding and robustness. However, most of them are either focusing on the language side or coarsely studying the pixel-level attention maps. In this paper, by leveraging the step-wise object grounding annotations provided in the GQA dataset, we first present a systematical object-centric diagnosis of visual reasoning on grounding and robustness, particularly on the vision side. According to the extensive comparisons across different models, we find that even models with high accuracy are not good at grounding objects precisely, nor robust to visual content perturbations. In contrast, symbolic and modular models have a relatively better grounding and robustness, though at the cost of accuracy. To reconcile these different aspects, we further develop a diagnostic model, namely Graph Reasoning Machine. Our model replaces purely symbolic visual representation with probabilistic scene graph and then applies teacher-forcing training for the visual reasoning module. The designed model improves the performance on all three metrics over the vanilla neural-symbolic model while inheriting the transparency. Further ablation studies suggest that this improvement is mainly due to more accurate image understanding and proper intermediate reasoning supervisions.",

    "abstract": "We propose the Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner (NS-CL), a model that learns visual concepts, words, and semantic parsing of sentences without explicit supervision on any of them; instead, our model learns by simply looking at images and reading paired questions and answers. Our model builds an object-based scene representation and translates sentences into executable, symbolic programs. To bridge the learning of two modules, we use a neuro-symbolic reasoning module that executes these programs on the latent scene representation. Analogical to human concept learning, the perception module learns visual concepts based on the language description of the object being referred to. Meanwhile, the learned visual concepts facilitate learning new words and parsing new sentences. We use curriculum learning to guide the searching over the large compositional space of images and language. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our model on learning visual concepts, word representations, and semantic parsing of sentences. Further, our method allows easy generalization to new object attributes, compositions, language concepts, scenes and questions, and even new program domains. It also empowers applications including visual question answering and bidirectional image-text retrieval.",

    "abstract": "We present Grammar-Based Grounded Lexicon Learning (G2L2), a lexicalist approach toward learning a compositional and grounded meaning representation of language from grounded data, such as paired images and texts. At the core of G2L2 is a collection of lexicon entries, which map each word to a tuple of a syntactic type and a neuro-symbolic semantic program. For example, the word shiny has a syntactic type of adjective; its neuro-symbolic semantic program has the symbolic form λ x. filter(x, SHINY), where the concept SHINY is associated with a neural network embedding, which will be used to classify shiny objects. Given an input sentence, G2L2 first looks up the lexicon entries associated with each token. It then derives the meaning of the sentence as an executable neuro-symbolic program by composing lexical meanings based on syntax. The recovered meaning programs can be executed on grounded inputs. To facilitate learning in an exponentially-growing compositional space, we introduce a joint parsing and expected execution algorithm, which does local marginalization over derivations to reduce the training time. We evaluate G2L2 on two domains: visual reasoning and language-driven navigation. Results show that G2L2 can generalize from small amounts of data to novel compositions of words.",

Among these, travel planning represents a prominent domain, combining academic challenges with practical value due to its complexity and market demand. However, existing benchmarks fail to reflect the diverse, real-world requirements crucial for deployment. To address this gap, we introduce ChinaTravel, a benchmark specifically designed for authentic Chinese travel planning scenarios. We collect the travel requirements from questionnaires and propose a compositionally generalizable domain-specific language that enables a scalable evaluation process, covering feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and preference comparison. Empirical studies reveal the potential of neuro-symbolic agents in travel planning, achieving a constraint satisfaction rate of 27.9%, significantly surpassing purely neural models at 2.6%. Moreover, we identify key challenges in real-world travel planning deployments, including open language reasoning and unseen concept composition. These findings highlight the significance of ChinaTravel as a pivotal milestone for advancing language agents in complex, real-world planning scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph reasoning is the fundamental component to support machine learning applications such as information extraction, information retrieval, and recommendation. Since knowledge graphs can be viewed as the discrete symbolic representations of knowledge, reasoning on knowledge graphs can naturally leverage the symbolic techniques. However, symbolic reasoning is intolerant of the ambiguous and noisy data. On the contrary, the recent advances of deep learning promote neural reasoning on knowledge graphs, which is robust to the ambiguous and noisy data, but lacks interpretability compared to symbolic reasoning. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies, recent efforts have been made on combining the two reasoning methods. In this survey, we take a thorough look at the development of the symbolic, neural and hybrid reasoning on knowledge graphs. We survey two specific reasoning tasks, knowledge graph completion and question answering on knowledge graphs, and explain them in a unified reasoning framework. We also briefly discuss the future directions for knowledge graph reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Food information engineering relies on statistical and AI techniques (e.g., symbolic, connectionist, and neurosymbolic AI) for collecting, storing, processing, diffusing, and putting food information in a form exploitable by humans and machines. Food information is collected manually and automatically. Once collected, food information is organized using tabular data representation schema, symbolic, connectionist or neurosymbolic AI techniques. Once collected, processed, and stored, food information is diffused to different stakeholders using appropriate formats. Even if neurosymbolic AI has shown promising results in many domains, we found that this approach is rarely used in the domain of food information engineering. This paper aims to serve as a good reference for food information engineering researchers. Unlike existing reviews on the subject, we cover all the aspects of food information engineering and we linked the paper to online resources built using Open Research Knowledge Graph. These resources are composed of templates, comparison tables of research contributions and smart reviews. All these resources are organized in the ``Food Information Engineering '' observatory and will be continually updated with new research contributions.",

In contrast to other NASI drugs proquazone is a nonacidic compound which is known to be a potent prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor. Of the 15 patients 8 were healed completely with proquazone; in half of these patients lesions recurred but healed with reintroduction of the drug. Two patients remained symptom-free with a small maintenance dose. Two patients showed a partial remission. The treatment was discontinued in 3 patients, in 2 of them because of side effects and in 1 because of lack of response. Two other NSAI drugs, both known to be potent prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, namely indomethacin and ibuprofen, were tried, however without effect. The present study indicates that proquazone should be considered in the treatment of LIS.",

In this initial case-study, we investigate the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on this task. While results are mixed, we see potential in improving on the weaknesses of purely symbolic systems.

    "year": "2007",
    "author": "Johns, L. D. and Straub, S. J. and Howard, S. M.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Spatial average intensity (SAI) is often used by clinicians to gauge therapeutic ultrasound dosage, yet SAI measures are not directly regulated by US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards. Current FDA guidelines permit a possible 50% to 150% minimum to maximum range of SAI values, potentially contributing to variability in clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To measure clinical values that describe ultrasound transducers and to determine the degree of intramanufacturer and intermanufacturer variability in effective radiating area, power, and SAI when the transducer is functioning at 3 MHz. DESIGN: A descriptive and interferential approach was taken to this quasi-experimental design. SETTING: Measurement laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six 5-cm(2) ultrasound transducers were purchased from 6 different manufacturers. INTERVENTION(S): All transducers were calibrated and then assessed using standardized measurement techniques; SAI was normalized to account for variability in effective radiating area, resulting in an nSAI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Effective radiating area, power, and nSAI. RESULTS: All manufacturers with the exception of Omnisound (P = .534) showed a difference between the reported and measured effective radiating area values (P < .001). All transducers were within FDA guidelines for power (+/-20%). Chattanooga (0.85 +/- 0.05 W/cm(2)) had a lower nSAI (P < .05) than all other manufacturers functioning at 3 MHz. Intramanufacturer variability in SAI ranged from 16% to 35%, and intermanufacturer variability ranged from 22% to 61%. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should consider treatment values of each individual transducer, regardless of the manufacturer. In addition, clinicians should scrutinize the power calibration and recalibration record of the transducer and adjust clinical settings as needed for the desired level of heating. Our data may aid in explaining the reported heating differences among transducers from different manufacturers. Stricter FDA standards regarding effective radiating area and total power are needed, and standards regulating SAI should be established.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimum endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women with advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer that has progressed on non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) is unclear. The aim of the SoFEA trial was to assess a maximum double endocrine targeting approach with the steroidal anti-oestrogen fulvestrant in combination with continued oestrogen deprivation. METHODS: In a composite, multicentre, phase 3 randomised controlled trial done in the UK and South Korea, postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer (oestrogen receptor [ER] positive, progesterone receptor [PR] positive, or both) were eligible if they had relapsed or progressed with locally advanced or metastatic disease on an NSAI (given as adjuvant for at least 12 months or as first-line treatment for at least 6 months). Additionally, patients had to have adequate organ function and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to receive fulvestrant (500 mg intramuscular injection on day 1, followed by 250 mg doses on days 15 and 29, and then every 28 days) plus daily oral anastrozole (1 mg); fulvestrant plus anastrozole-matched placebo; or daily oral exemestane (25 mg). Randomisation was done with computer-generated permuted blocks, and stratification was by centre and previous use of an NSAI as adjuvant treatment or for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Participants and investigators were aware of assignment to fulvestrant or exemestane, but not of assignment to anastrozole or placebo. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00253422 (UK) and NCT00944918 (South Korea). FINDINGS: Between March 26, 2004, and Aug 6, 2010, 723 patients underwent randomisation: 243 were assigned to receive fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 231 to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 249 to exemestane. Median PFS was 4·4 months (95% CI 3·4-5·4) in patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 4·8 months (3·6-5·5) in those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 3·4 months (3·0-4·6) in those assigned to exemestane. No difference was recorded between the patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole and fulvestrant plus placebo (hazard ratio 1·00, 95% CI 0·83-1·21; log-rank p=0·98), or between those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo and exemestane (0·95, 0·79-1·14; log-rank p=0·56). 87 serious adverse events were reported: 36 in patients assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole, 22 in those assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo, and 29 in those assigned to exemestane. Grade 3-4 adverse events were rare; the most frequent were arthralgia (three in the group assigned to fulvestrant plus anastrozole; seven in that assigned to fulvestrant plus placebo; eight in that assigned to exemestane), lethargy (three; 11; 11), and nausea or vomiting (five; two; eight). INTERPRETATION: After loss of response to NSAIs in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer, maximum double endocrine treatment with 250 mg fulvestrant combined with oestrogen deprivation is no better than either fulvestrant alone or exemestane.",

We investigate the architecture and propose two key components. We first remove a series of different transformer layers that are used in every step by introducing a mixture of experts. This results in a Differentiable Tree Experts model with a constant number of parameters for any arbitrary number of steps in the computation, compared to the previous method in the Differentiable Tree Machine with a linear growth. Given this flexibility in the number of steps, we additionally propose a new termination algorithm to provide the model the power to choose how many steps to make automatically. The resulting Terminating Differentiable Tree Experts model sluggishly learns to predict the number of steps without an oracle. It can do so while maintaining the learning capabilities of the model, converging to the optimal amount of steps.",

    "abstract": "A central but unresolved aspect of problem-solving in AI is the capability to introduce and use abstractions, something humans excel at. Work in cognitive science has demonstrated that humans tend towards higher levels of abstraction when engaged in collaborative task-oriented communication, enabling gradually shorter and more information-efficient utterances. Several computational methods have attempted to replicate this phenomenon, but all make unrealistic simplifying assumptions about how abstractions are introduced and learned. Our method, Procedural Abstractions for Communicating Efficiently (PACE), overcomes these limitations through a neuro-symbolic approach. On the symbolic side, we draw on work from library learning for proposing abstractions. We combine this with neural methods for communication and reinforcement learning, via a novel use of bandit algorithms for controlling the exploration and exploitation trade-off in introducing new abstractions. PACE exhibits similar tendencies to humans on a collaborative construction task from the cognitive science literature, where one agent (the architect) instructs the other (the builder) to reconstruct a scene of block-buildings. PACE results in the emergence of an efficient language as a by-product of collaborative communication. Beyond providing mechanistic insights into human communication, our work serves as a first step to providing conversational agents with the ability for human-like communicative abstractions.",

    "abstract": "It is expected that progress toward true artificial intelligence will be achieved through the emergence of a system that integrates representation learning and complex reasoning (LeCun et al. 2015). In response to this prediction, research has been conducted on implementing the symbolic reasoning of a von Neumann computer in an artificial neural network (Graves et al. 2016; Graves et al. 2014; Reed et al. 2015). However, these studies have many limitations in realizing neural-symbolic integration (Jaeger. 2016). Here, we present a new learning paradigm: a learning solving procedure (LSP) that learns the procedure for solving complex problems. This is not accomplished merely by learning input-output data, but by learning algorithms through a solving procedure that obtains the output as a sequence of tasks for a given input problem. The LSP neural network system not only learns simple problems of addition and multiplication, but also the algorithms of complicated problems, such as complex arithmetic expression, sorting, and Hanoi Tower. To realize this, the LSP neural network structure consists of a deep neural network and long short-term memory, which are recursively combined. Through experimentation, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of LSP and its validity as a mechanism of complex reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Several methods have been proposed recently to learn neural network (NN) controllers for autonomous agents, with unknown and stochastic dynamics, tasked with complex missions captured by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Due to the sample-inefficiency of the majority of these works, compositional learning methods have been proposed decomposing the LTL specification into smaller sub-tasks. Then, separate controllers are learned and composed to satisfy the original task. A key challenge within these approaches is that they often lack safety guarantees or the provided guarantees are impractical. This paper aims to address this challenge. Particularly, we consider autonomous systems with unknown and stochastic dynamics and LTL-encoded tasks. We assume that the system is equipped with a finite set of base skills modeled by trained NN feedback controllers. Our goal is to check if there exists a temporal composition of the trained NN controllers - and if so, to compute it - that will yield a composite system behavior that satisfies the assigned LTL task with probability one. We propose a new approach that relies on a novel integration of automata theory and data-driven reachability analysis tools for",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses planning problems for mobile robots. We consider missions that require accomplishing multiple high-level sub-tasks, expressed in natural language (NL), in a temporal and logical order. To formally define the mission, we treat these sub-tasks as atomic predicates in a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. We refer to this task specification framework as LTL-NL. Our goal is to design plans, defined as sequences of robot actions, accomplishing LTL-NL tasks. This action planning problem cannot be solved directly by existing LTL planners because of the NL nature of atomic predicates. To address it, we propose HERACLEs, a hierarchical neuro-symbolic planner that relies on a novel integration of (i) existing symbolic planners generating high-level task plans determining the order at which the NL sub-tasks should be accomplished; (ii) pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design sequences of robot actions based on these task plans; and (iii) conformal prediction acting as a formal interface between (i) and (ii) and managing uncertainties due to LLM imperfections. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that HERACLEs can achieve user-defined mission success rates. Finally, we provide comparative experiments demonstrating that HERACLEs outperforms LLM-based planners that require the mission to be defined solely using NL. Additionally, we present examples demonstrating that our approach enhances user-friendliness compared to conventional symbolic approaches.",

Inspired by the observation that text often introduces ambiguities that diagrams can clarify, this paper presents Pi-GPS, a novel framework that unleashes the power of diagrammatic information to resolve textual ambiguities, an aspect largely overlooked in prior research. Specifically, we design a micro module comprising a rectifier and verifier: the rectifier employs MLLMs to disambiguate text based on the diagrammatic context, while the verifier ensures the rectified output adherence to geometric rules, mitigating model hallucinations. Additionally, we explore the impact of LLMs in theorem predictor based on the disambiguated formal language. Empirical results demonstrate that Pi-GPS surpasses state-of-the-art models, achieving a nearly 10% improvement on Geometry3K over prior neural-symbolic approaches. We hope this work highlights the significance of resolving textual ambiguity in multimodal mathematical reasoning, a crucial factor limiting performance.",

    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging branch of AI that combines the strengths of symbolic AI and sub-symbolic AI. A major drawback of sub-symbolic AI is that it acts as a black box , meaning that predictions are difficult to explain, making the testing & evaluation (T&E) and validation & verification (V&V) processes of a system that uses sub-symbolic AI a challenge. Since neurosymbolic AI combines the advantages of both symbolic and sub-symbolic AI, this survey explores how neurosymbolic applications can ease the V&V process. This survey considers two taxonomies of neurosymbolic AI, evaluates them, and analyzes which algorithms are commonly used as the symbolic and sub-symbolic components in current applications. Additionally, an overview of current techniques for the T&E and V&V processes of these components is provided. Furthermore, it is investigated how the symbolic part is used for T&E and V&V purposes in current neurosymbolic applications. Our research shows that neurosymbolic AI as great potential to ease the T&E and V&V processes of sub-symbolic AI by leveraging the possibilities of symbolic AI. Additionally, the applicability of current T&E and V&V methods to neurosymbolic AI is assessed, and how different neurosymbolic architectures can impact these methods is explored. It is found that current T&E and V&V techniques are partly sufficient to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the symbolic and sub-symbolic part of neurosymbolic applications independently, while some of them use approaches where current T&E and V&V methods are not applicable by default, and adjustments or even new approaches are needed. Our research shows that there is great potential in using symbolic AI to test, evaluate, verify, or validate the predictions of a sub-symbolic model, making neurosymbolic AI an interesting research direction for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI.",

    "abstract": "We consider a weakly supervised learning scenario where the supervision signal is generated by a transition function σ of labels associated with multiple input instances. We formulate this problem as \\emph multi-instance Partial Label Learning (multi-instance PLL) , which is an extension to the standard PLL problem. Our problem is met in different fields, including latent structural learning and neuro-symbolic integration. Despite the existence of many learning techniques, limited theoretical analysis has been dedicated to this problem. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical study of multi-instance PLL with possibly an unknown transition σ. Our main contributions are as follows. Firstly, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for the learnability of the problem. This condition non-trivially generalizes and relaxes the existing small ambiguity degree in the PLL literature, since we allow the transition to be deterministic. Secondly, we derive Rademacher-style error bounds based on a top-k surrogate loss that is widely used in the neuro-symbolic literature. Furthermore, we conclude with empirical experiments for learning under unknown transitions. The empirical results align with our theoretical findings; however, they also expose the issue of scalability in the weak supervision literature.",

At the same time, the supervision signal is generated by a function σ over the (hidden) gold labels of 𝐱 . In this work, we make multiple contributions towards addressing a problem that hasn't been studied so far in the context of MI-PLL: that of characterizing and mitigating *learning imbalances*, i.e., major differences in the errors occurring when classifying instances of different classes (aka *class-specific risks*). In terms of theory, we derive class-specific risk bounds for MI-PLL, while making minimal assumptions. Our theory reveals a unique phenomenon: that σ can greatly impact learning imbalances. This result is in sharp contrast with previous research on supervised and weakly-supervised learning, which only studies learning imbalances under the prism of data imbalances. On the practical side, we introduce a technique for estimating the marginal of the hidden labels using only MI-PLL data. Then, we introduce algorithms that mitigate imbalances at training- and testing-time, by treating the marginal of the hidden labels as a constraint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques using strong baselines from neurosymbolic and long-tail learning, suggesting performance improvements of up to 14%.",

    "abstract": "Non-extractive commonsense QA remains a challenging AI task, as it requires systems to reason about, synthesize, and gather disparate pieces of information, in order to generate responses to queries. Recent approaches on such tasks show increased performance, only when models are either pre-trained with additional information or when domain-specific heuristics are used, without any special consideration regarding the knowledge resource type. In this paper, we perform a survey of recent commonsense QA methods and we provide a systematic analysis of popular knowledge resources and knowledge-integration methods, across benchmarks from multiple commonsense datasets. Our results and analysis show that attention-based injection seems to be a preferable choice for knowledge integration and that the degree of domain overlap, between knowledge bases and datasets, plays a crucial role in determining model success.",

    "abstract": "Building a conversational embodied agent to execute real-life tasks has been a long-standing yet quite challenging research goal, as it requires effective human-agent communication, multi-modal understanding, long-range sequential decision making, etc. Traditional symbolic methods have scaling and generalization issues, while end-to-end deep learning models suffer from data scarcity and high task complexity, and are often hard to explain. To benefit from both worlds, we propose JARVIS, a neuro-symbolic commonsense reasoning framework for modular, generalizable, and interpretable conversational embodied agents. First, it acquires symbolic representations by prompting large language models (LLMs) for language understanding and sub-goal planning, and by constructing semantic maps from visual observations. Then the symbolic module reasons for sub-goal planning and action generation based on task- and action-level common sense. Extensive experiments on the TEACh dataset validate the efficacy and efficiency of our JARVIS framework, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on all three dialog-based embodied tasks, including Execution from Dialog History (EDH), Trajectory from Dialog (TfD), and Two-Agent Task Completion (TATC) (e.g., our method boosts the unseen Success Rate on EDH from 6.1% to 15.8%). Moreover, we systematically analyze the essential factors that affect the task performance and also demonstrate the superiority of our method in few-shot settings. Our JARVIS model ranks first in the Alexa Prize SimBot Public Benchmark Challenge.",

    "abstract": "There are concerns about the reliability and safety of artificial intelligence (AI) based on sub-symbolic neural networks because its decisions cannot be explained explicitly. This is the black box problem of modern AI. At the same time, symbolic AI has the nature of a white box and is able to ensure the reliability and safety of its decisions. However, several problems prevent the widespread use of symbolic AI: the opacity of mathematical models and natural language terms, the lack of a unified ontology, and the combinatorial explosion of search capabilities. To solve the black-box problem of AI, we propose eXplicitly eXplainable AI (XXAI) - a fully transparent white-box AI based on deterministic logical cellular automata whose rules are derived from the first principles of the general theory of the relevant domain. In this case, the general theory of the domain plays the role of a knowledge base for deriving the inferences of the cellular automata. A cellular automaton implements parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization - from local interactions of the element base to the system as a whole. Our verification of several ecological hypotheses sets a precedent for the successful implementation of the proposed solution. XXAI is able to automatically verify the reliability, security and ethics of sub-symbolic neural network solutions in both the final and training phases. In this article, we present precedents for the successful implementation of XXAI, the theoretical and methodological foundations for its further development, and discuss prospects for the future.",

    "abstract": "The perpetual evolution of cyberattacks, especially in the realm of Internet of Things (IoT) networks, necessitates advanced, adaptive, and intelligent defence mechanisms. The integration of expert knowledge can drastically enhance the efficacy of IoT network attack detection systems by enabling them to leverage domain-specific insights. This paper introduces a novel approach by applying Neurosymbolic Learning within the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework to enhance the detection of IoT network attacks while ensuring interpretability and transparency in decision-making. Neurosymbolic Learning synergizes symbolic AI, which excels in handling structured knowledge and providing explainability, with neural networks, known for their prowess in learning from data. Our proposed model utilizes expert knowledge in the form of rules and heuristics, integrating them into a learning mechanism to enhance its predictive capabilities and facilitate the incorporation of domain-specific insights into the learning process. The XAI framework is deployed to ensure that the predictive model is not a ``black box '' , providing clear, understandable explanations for its predictions, thereby augmenting trust and facilitating further enhancement by domain experts. Through rigorous evaluation against benchmark IoT network attack datasets, our model demonstrates superior detection performance compared to prevailing models, along with enhanced explainability and the successful incorporation of expert knowledge into the adaptive learning process. The proposed approach not only fortifies the security mechanisms against network attacks in IoT environments but also ensures that the knowledge discovery and decision-making processes are transparent, interpretable, and verifiable by human experts.",

    "abstract": "Despite the surprising power of many modern AI systems that often learn their own representations, there is significant discontent about their inscrutability and the attendant problems in their ability to interact with humans. While alternatives such as neuro-symbolic approaches have been proposed, there is a lack of consensus on what they are about. There are often two independent motivations (i) symbols as a lingua franca for human-AI interaction and (ii) symbols as system-produced abstractions used by the AI system in its internal reasoning. The jury is still out on whether AI systems will need to use symbols in their internal reasoning to achieve general intelligence capabilities. Whatever the answer there is, the need for (human-understandable) symbols in human-AI interaction seems quite compelling. Symbols, like emotions, may well not be sine qua non for intelligence per se, but they will be crucial for AI systems to interact with us humans - as we can neither turn off our emotions nor get by without our symbols. In particular, in many human-designed domains, humans would be interested in providing explicit (symbolic) knowledge and advice - and expect machine explanations in kind. This alone requires AI systems to to maintain a symbolic interface for interaction with humans. In this blue sky paper, we argue this point of view, and discuss research directions that need to be pursued to allow for this type of human-AI interaction.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable confusion about the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in planning and reasoning tasks. On one side are over-optimistic claims that LLMs can indeed do these tasks with just the right prompting or self-verification strategies. On the other side are perhaps over-pessimistic claims that all that LLMs are good for in planning/reasoning tasks are as mere translators of the problem specification from one syntactic format to another, and ship the problem off to external symbolic solvers. In this position paper, we take the view that both these extremes are misguided. We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature. We will also argue that LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much more meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple front-end/back-end format translators. We present a vision of 𝐋𝐋𝐌-𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐨 𝐅𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤𝐬 that combine the strengths of LLMs with external model-based verifiers in a tighter bi-directional interaction regime. We will show how the models driving the external verifiers themselves can be acquired with the help of LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply pipelining LLMs and symbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better neuro-symbolic approach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic components, and allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes towards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications.",

    "abstract": "Natural logic reasoning has received increasing attention lately, with several datasets and neural models proposed, though with limited success. More recently, a new class of works have emerged adopting a Neuro-Symbolic approach, called transformer guided chaining, whereby the idea is to iteratively perform 1-step neural inferences and chain together the results to generate a multi-step reasoning trace. Several works have adapted variants of this central idea and reported significantly high accuracies compared to vanilla LLM's. In this paper, we perform a critical empirical investigation of the chaining approach on a multi-hop First-Order Logic (FOL) reasoning benchmark. In particular, we develop a reference implementation, called Chainformer, and conduct several experiments to analyze the accuracy, generalization, interpretability, and performance over FOLs. Our findings highlight key strengths and possible current limitations and suggest potential areas for future research in logic reasoning.",

    "year": "2019",
    "author": "Kara, Kenan Abdurrahman",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Aim: When selecting a graft for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), it is necessary to consider the quality of life and life expectancy of the patient besides ensuring complete revascularization. Use of multiple artery grafts confers the advantage over venous grafts because of their longer patency rates. The aim of this study is to evaluate our experiences in the use of arterial grafts and draw attention to the use of multiple artery grafts. Accordingly, coronary bypass surgeries that we have performed by using multiple arterial grafts were reviewed in our study. Material and Method: Between January 2017 and December 2017, 10 patients (8 males average age: 52.75 2 females average age: 61) had undergone CABG surgery by using multiple arterial grafts. We used the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and radial artery (RA) in 2 patients, LIMA and right internal mammary artery (RIMA) in 6 patients and LIMA-RIMA and radial artery in 2 patients. In 2 of these patients, a T-graft was constructed by anastomosing the proximal end of the free RIMA to the side of the attached LIMA. In all cases, the radial artery was proximally anastomosed to the aorta. All patients were followed up in the intensive care unit for 2 days. Patients were discharged from the hospital in 5-6 days on average. Results: Patients were evaluated in terms of operative mortality, cross clamp time, intensive care and hospitalization period, pain in the incision area, management of post-extubation saturation levels, postoperative complications, recurrent angina, myocardial infarction (MI) and reoperation. No complications were reported during the early period of our evaluations. Although low levels of saturation were detected during this time in patients for whom bilateral IMA was used, saturation increased in the following days with no complications. No sternal dehiscence or infections were observed in patients. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) and paracetamol anti-analgesics were given to all patients. For measurement of incision area pain, a pain index test was implemented. Discussion: In patients, whose venous grafts are used following CABG, early period graft thromboses lead to repetitive interventional operations and increase in re-operations. Although the superiority of CABG operation versus stent operation is accepted for multiple vein patients, many cardiologists and patients carry objections against the repetitive interventional operations that may arise due to early graft failure and the consequent increase in early period mortality and morbidity risk. We believe that we can overcome these risks by use of multiple artery grafts which allow for a higher patency rate over the long term.",

We provide formal semantics that demonstrate that our knowledge representation captures all of first order logic and that finite sampling from infinite domains converges to correct truth values. DASL's representation improves on prior neural-symbolic work by avoiding vanishing gradients, allowing deeper logical structure, and enabling richer interactions between the knowledge and learning components. We illustrate DASL through a toy problem in which we add structure to an image classification problem and demonstrate that knowledge of that structure reduces data requirements by a factor of 1000. We then evaluate DASL on a visual relationship detection task and demonstrate that the addition of commonsense knowledge improves performance by 10.7% in a data scarce setting.",

We propose Common-Sense based Neuro-Symbolic Loss (CSNL) that formulates prior knowledge as novel neuro-symbolic loss functions that regularize visual-semantic embedding. CSNL forces visual features in the VSE to obey common-sense rules relating to hypernyms and attributes. We introduce two key novelties for improved learning: (1) enforcement of rules for a group instead of a single concept to take into account class-wise relationships, and (2) confidence margins inside logical operators that enable implicit curriculum learning and prevent premature overfitting. We evaluate the advantages of incorporating each knowledge source and show consistent gains over prior state-of-art methods in both conventional and generalized ZSL e.g. 11.5%, 5.5%, and 11.6% improvements on AWA2, CUB, and Kinetics respectively.",

    "abstract": "Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) is a powerful computing model that is built on a rich algebra in which all representations-from atomic to composite structures-are high-dimensional holographic distributed vectors of the same, fixed dimensionality. VSA is mainly characterized by the following intriguing properties: (i) quasi-orthogonality of a randomly chosen vector to other random vectors with very high probability, aka concentration of measure; (ii) exponential growth of the number of such quasi-orthogonal vectors with the dimensionality, which provides a sufficiently large capacity to accommodate novel concepts over time; (iii) availability of these vectors to be composed, decomposed, probed, and transformed in various ways using a set of well-defined operations. Motivated by these properties, this chapter presents a summary of recently developed methodologies on the integration of VSA with deep neural networks that enabled impactful applications to few-shot [ 1] and continual [ 2, 3] learning. Resorting to VSA-based embedding allows deep neural networks to quickly learn from few training samples by storing them in an explicit memory, where many more class categories can be continually expressed in the abstract vector space of VSA with fixed dimensions, without causing interference among the learned classes. Experiments on various image datasets show that the considered neuro-symbolic AI approach outperforms pure deep neural network baselines with remarkable accuracy, scalability, and compute/memory efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Swarm intelligence is a research area that models the population of the swarm based on natural computation. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is a swarm based metaheuristic algorithm introduced by Karaboga to optimize numerical problem. Pattern-SAT is a pattern reconstruction paradigm that utilized 2SAT logical rule in representing the behavior of the desired pattern. The information of the desired pattern in terms of 2SAT logic is embedded to Hopfield neural network (HNN-P2SAT) and the desired pattern is reconstructed during the retrieval phase. Since the performance of HNN-P2SAT in Pattern-SAT deteriorates when the number of 2SAT clause increased, newly improved ABC is used to reduce the computation burden during the learning phase of HNN-P2SAT (HNN-P2SATABC). The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of Pattern-SAT produced by ABC incorporated with HNN-P2SAT and compare it with conventional standalone HNN. The comparison is examined by using Microsoft Visual Basic C++ 2013 software. The detailed comparison in doing Pattern-SAT is discussed based on global Pattern-SAT, ratio of activated clauses and computation time. The result obtained from computer simulation indicates the beneficial features of HNN-P2SATABC in doing Pattern-SAT. This finding is expected to result in a significant implication on the choice of searching method used to do Pattern-SAT.",

    "abstract": "An interactive instruction following task has been proposed as a benchmark for learning to map natural language instructions and first-person vision into sequences of actions to interact with objects in 3D environments. We found that an existing end-to-end neural model for this task tends to fail to interact with objects of unseen attributes and follow various instructions. We assume that this problem is caused by the high sensitivity of neural feature extraction to small changes in vision and language inputs. To mitigate this problem, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach that utilizes high-level symbolic features, which are robust to small changes in raw inputs, as intermediate representations. We verify the effectiveness of our model with the subtask evaluation on the ALFRED benchmark. Our experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms the end-to-end neural model by 9, 46, and 74 points in the success rate on the ToggleObject, PickupObject, and SliceObject subtasks in unseen environments respectively.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Training a reinforcement learning agent to learn network penetration testing is challenging due to the partially-observable, non-deterministic environment. The large action space leads to extended training time, an issue of particular concern in mission-oriented network deployment that requires timely hardening tests. Current solutions for automating penetration testing are divided between reinforcement learning (RL) and AI planning. This work integrates the two paradigms and establishes a neuro-symbolic agent training system through an interactive symbolic logic engine. Two methods are examined for accelerating the pentest agent training in this system, namely: invalid action masking for Deep Q-Networks and using a symbolic logic engine as an environment driver. The results show that invalid action masking is highly effective at reducing the number of steps to convergence, while the logic-based simulator provides a significant per-step performance improvement to speed up training. These results highlight that a hybrid neuro-symbolic approach is a viable, and perhaps even necessary, method for developing and improving cyber RL agents.",

    "abstract": "Language models for American Sign Language (ASL) could make language technologies substantially more accessible to those who sign. To train models on tasks such as isolated sign recognition (ISR) and ASL-to-English translation, datasets provide annotated video examples of ASL signs. To facilitate the generalizability and explainability of these models, we introduce the American Sign Language Knowledge Graph (ASLKG), compiled from twelve sources of expert linguistic knowledge. We use the ASLKG to train neuro-symbolic models for 3 ASL understanding tasks, achieving accuracies of 91% on ISR, 14% for predicting the semantic features of unseen signs, and 36% for classifying the topic of Youtube-ASL videos.",

    "abstract": "Adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are mostly benign and nonsecretory. Management algorithms lack sensitivity when assessing malignant potential, although functional status is easier to assess. We present a subject whose AI was a retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma (RL). Case Presentation. A woman on warfarin with SLE and the antiphospholipid syndrome, presented with left loin pain. She was normotensive and clinically normal. Ultrasound scans demonstrated left kidney scarring, but CT scans revealed an AI. MRI scans later confirmed the AI without significant fat and no interval growth. Cortisol after 1 mg dexamethasone, urinary free cortisol and catecholamines, plasma aldosterone renin ratio, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone were within the reference range. Initially, adrenal haemorrhage was diagnosed because of warfarin therapy and the acute presentation. However, she underwent adrenalectomy because of interval growth of the AI. Histology confirmed an RL. The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy. Discussion. Our subject presented with an NSAI. However, we highlight the following: (a) the diagnosis of adrenal haemorrhage in this anticoagulated woman was revised because of interval growth; (b) the tumour, an RL, was relatively small at diagnosis;",

    "abstract": "2 Satisfiability (2SAT) is a language that bridges real life application to neural network optimization. 2SAT is an interesting paradigm because the outcome of this logical rule is always positive. Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) is a type of neural network that finds the solution based on energy minimization. Interesting intelligent behavior has been observed when logical rule is embedded to HNN. Increasing the storage capacity during learning phase of HNN has been a challenging problem for most neural network researchers. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a population-based and nature-inspired algorithm to decipher several combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, metaheuristic algorithm ACO will be proposed in learning 2SAT programming. To this end, all the learning model will be tested in a new restricted learning environment. In circumstances of where HNN model was not given unlimited iteration until all 2SAT clauses were fully satisfied, we would like to determine the better performing search method between exhaustive search and ACO. Results acquired from the computer simulation showed that ACO outperformed exhaustive search in restricted learning environment.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested a lack of complete cross-resistance between steroidal (exemestane) and non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (nSAI). METHODS: Eighty-eight metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients who received 25 mg of exemestane orally once a day at the National Cancer Center, Korea, between 2003 and 2009, were reviewed retrospectively. All patients had received nSAI for metastatic disease prior to exemestane therapy. RESULTS: The median age was 52 years (range, 33-79), and 13 (14.8%) patients were premenopausal who concomitantly received GnRH agonist. Exemestane was given as a second- (80.7%) or third-line (19.3%) hormone therapy. The clinical benefit (CB) rate (complete response + partial response + stable disease ≥ 24 weeks) was 30.7%, with a median CB duration of 10.0 months (range, 6.3-78.7). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.99-4.01) and the overall survival (OS) 21.5 months (95% CI, 17.96-25.04), with a median follow-up of 50.3 months. Patients who achieved CB had longer OS than those patients who did not (29.6 vs 17.9 months; P = 0.002). On univariate analysis of predictive factors, patients who had achieved CB from previous nSAI tended to show lower CB rate (24.6% vs 44.4%, respectively; P = 0.063) and shorter PFS (2.8 vs 4.8 months, respectively; p = 0.233) than patients who had not. Achieving CB from previous nSAI became independent predictive factor for CBR to exemestane on multivariable analysis (Odds ratio = 2.852, P = 0.040). CONCLUSIONS: Exemestane after nSAI failure was effective in prolonging CB duration. The drug's efficacy seemed to be inferior in patients who had benefit from previous nSAI use.",

    "abstract": "One of the current main goals of artificial intelligence and robotics research is the creation of an artificial assistant which can have flexible, human like behavior, in order to accomplish everyday tasks. A lot of what is context-independent task knowledge to the human is what enables this flexibility at multiple levels of cognition.In this scope the author analyzes how to acquire, represent and disambiguate symbolic knowledge representing context-independent task knowledge, abstracted from multiple instances: this thesis elaborates the incurred problems, implementation constraints, current state-of-the-art practices and ultimately the solutions newly introduced in this scope.The author specifically discusses acquisition of context-independent task knowledge from large amounts of human-written texts and their reusability in the robotics domain; the acquisition of knowledge on human musculoskeletal dependencies constraining motion which allows a better higher level representation of observed trajectories; the means of verbalization of partial contextual and instruction knowledge, increasing interaction possibilities with the human as well as contextual adaptation. All the aforementioned points are supported by evaluation in heterogeneous setups, to bring a view on how to make optimal use of statistical & symbolic applications (i.e. neurosymbolic reasoning) in cognitive robotics. This work has been performed to enable context-adaptable artificial assistants, by bringing together knowledge on what is usually regarded as context-independent task knowledge.",

    "abstract": "fBackground Breast surgery encompasses oncologic, reconstructive, and cosmetic procedures. With the recent focus on the over-prescribing of opioids in the literature, it is important to assess the effectiveness and safety of non-opioid pain medication regimens including nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSA1Ds) or NSAID pain medications. Clinicians have differing opinions on the safety of perioperative (relating to, occurring in, or being the period around the time of a surgical operation) NSAIDs for breast surgery given the unclear risk/benefit ratio. NSA1Ds have been shown to decrease inflammation, pain, and fever, while potentially increasing the risks of bleeding complications. Objectives To assess the effects of perioperative NSAID use versus non-NSAID analgesics (other pain medication of breast surgery. Search methods n wo en undergoing any form The Cochrane Breast Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group (CBCG) Specialized Register, CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, Embase, The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (1CTRP) and Clinicaltrials.gov registries to 21 September 2020. Full articles were retrieved for potentially eligible trials. Selection criteria We considered all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) looking at perioperative NSAID use in women undergoing breast surgery. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias, and certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The main outcomes were incidence of breast hematoma within 90 days (requiring reoperation, interventional drainage, or no treatment) of breast surgery and pain intensity 24 hours following surgery, incidence rate or severity of postoperative nausea, vomiting or both, bleeding from any location within 90 days, need for blood transfusion, other side effects of NSA1D use, opioid use within 24 hours of surgery, length of hospital stay, breast cancer recurrence, and non -prescribed NSAID use. Data were presented as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes. Main results We included 12 RCTs with a total of 1596 participants. Seven studies compared NSAIDs (ketorolac, diciofenac, flurbiprofen, parecoxib and celecoxib) to placebo. Four studies compared NSAIDs (ketorolac, flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, and celecoxib) to other analgesics (morphine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl). One study compared NSAI Ds (diciofenac) to no intervention. NSAIDs compared to placebo Most outcomes are judged to have low-certainty evidence unless stated otherwise. There may be little to no difference in the incidence of breast hematomas within 90 days of breast surgery (RR 0.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 2.02; 2 studies, 230 participants; 12 = 0%). NSAIDs may reduce pain intensity 24 ( 12) hours following surgery compared to placebo (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.03; 3 studies, 310 participants; 12 = 730/o). There may be little to no difference in the incidence rates or severities of postoperative nausea, vomiting, or both (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.27; 4 studies, 939 participants; 12 = 81%), bleeding from any location within 90 days (RR 1.05, 95% C10.89 to 1.24; 2 studies, 251 partici pa nts; 12 = 80/0), or need for blood transfusion compared to placebo groups, but vve are very uncertain (RR 4.62, 95% CI 0.23 to 91.34; 1 study, 48 participants; very low -certainty evidence). There may be no difference in other side effects (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.86; 2 studies, 251 participants; 12 = ON). NSAIDs may reduce opioid use within 24 hours of surgery com pared to placebo (SMD -0A5, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.05; 4 studies, 304 participants; 12 = 63%). NSAIDs compared to other analgesics There is little to no difference in the incidence of breast hematomasvvithin 90 days of breast surgery, but vve are very uncertain (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.99; 1 study, 100 participants; very low -certainty evidence). NSAIDs may reduce pain intensity 24 ( 12) hours following surgery (SMD -0.68, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.39; 3 studies, 200 participants; 12 = 89%; low-certainty evidence) and probably reduce the incidence rates or severities of postoperative nausea, vomiting, or both compared to other analgesics (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.57; 3 studies, 128 participants; 12 = 0%; moderate -certainty evidence). There is little to no difference in the development of bleeding from any location within 90 days of breast surgery or in other side effects, but we are very uncertain (bleeding: RR 0.33, 95% C10.01 to 7.99; 1 study, 100 participants; other side effects: RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.80; 1 study, 48 participants; very low -certainty evidence). NSAIDs may reduce opioid use within 24 hours of surgery compared to other analgesics (SMD -6.87, 95% CI -10.93 to -2.81; 3 studies, 178 participants; 12 = 96%; low -certainty evidence). NSAIDs compared to no intervention There is little to no difference in pain intensity 24 ( 12) hours following surgery compared to no intervention, but we are very uncertain (SMD -0.54, 95% Cl -1.09 to 0.00; 1 study, 60 participants; very low -certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions Low -certainty evidence suggests that NSAI Ds may reduce postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, and postoperative opioid use. However, there was very little evidence to indicate whether NSA1Ds affect the rate of breast hematoma or bleeding from any location within 90 days of breast surgery, the need for blood transfusion and incidence of other side effects compared to placebo or other analgesics. High quality large-scale RCTs are required before definitive conclusions can be made.",

    "abstract": "Neuro-Symbolic Integration is an interdisciplinary area that endeavours to unify neural networks and symbolic logic. The goal is to create a system that combines the advantages of neural networks (adaptive behaviour, robustness, tolerance of noise and probability) and symbolic logic (validity of computations, generality, higher-order reasoning). Several different approaches have been proposed in the past. However, the existing neuro-symbolic networks provide only a limited coverage of the techniques used in computational logic. In this paper, we outline the areas of neuro-symbolism where computational logic has been implemented so far, and analyse the problematic areas. We show why certain concepts cannot be implemented using the existing neuro-symbolic networks, and propose four main improvements needed to build neuro-symbolic networks of the future.",

    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic learning systems have been shown to quickly discover how to interact with discrete representations of the world. Symbolic learners often allow for a higher level of understandability than neural networks which learn feature vectors for actions being taken, as seen in modern reinforcement learning systems. Symbolic learners excel at learning higher-level concepts, but struggle with certain types of generalization. Symbolic learners might benefit in such situations from a learned representation of the world. This paper discusses a pipeline that uses state-of-the-art object and pose detection neural networks as input to a symbolic learning system. We show how the knowledge from the symbolic system can automatically correct object and pose data from the neural network and hence provide corrected samples that can be used to incrementally train and improve the neural network. We show how symbolic learning techniques can improve action detection when given example ground truths by humans. We also demonstrate how novel actions that are not recognized by humans might be recognized by a learning engine capable of recognizing results and preconditions for an action to be valid.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has made impressive strides but still lacks key concepts necessary to truly reason and act in the world. In parallel, symbolic learning systems have shown success at certain types of abstract reasoning, as demonstrated in the Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge by Kaggle. Yet, these symbolic learners are challenged when generalizing to data from the analog world. This paper will present and evaluate ideas for using symbolic learning concepts to guide learning of a neural network in a constructivist way. We aim to show how a neural network with internal feedback can be used - somewhat like the brain - to suggest the proper actions to take and predict the results of those actions. In other words, the system will create an internal model of the world on which it can reason. The neurosymbolic system we consider is inspired by the symbolic learning system from Gary Dresher and neural network cortical columns as discussed by Jeff Hawkins. The hybrid system aims to create a synthesis which can generalize on real-world concepts while also quickly learning from few examples as the world changes and prior experience is found to be inaccurate.",

    "abstract": "Modern supply chains are complex, interconnected systems that contain emergent, invisible dependencies. Lack of visibility often hinders effective risk planning and results in delayed discovery of supply chain problems, with examples ranging from product contamination, unsustainable production practices, or exposure to suppliers clustered in geographical areas prone to natural or man-made disasters. Initiatives that rely on manual collection of data often fail due to supply chain complexity and unwillingness of suppliers to share data. In this paper, we propose a neurosymbolic machine learning technique to proactively uncover hidden risks in supply chains and discover new information. Our method uses a combination of graph neural networks and knowledge graph reasoning. Unlike existing research our model is able to infer multiple types of hidden relationship risks, presenting a step change in automated supply chain surveillance. The approach has been tested on two empirical datasets from the automotive and energy industries, illustrating that it can provide inference in multiple types of links such as companies, products, production capabilities, certifications; thereby facilitating complex queries that go beyond who-supplies-whom. As such, additional risk insights can emerge from graph structure, providing practitioners with new knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments, forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover, we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of autonomous LLM agents.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective of our study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness (CE) study of combined everolimus (EVE) and exemestane (EXE) versus the common clinical practice in Greece for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (BC) progressing on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI). The combinations of bevacizumab (BEV) plus paclitaxel (PACL) and BEV plus capecitabine (CAPE) were selected as comparators. METHOD: A Markov model, consisting of three health states, was used to describe disease progression and evaluate the CE of the comparators from a third-party payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Efficacy and safety data as well as utility values considered in the model were extracted from the relevant randomized Phase III clinical trials and other published studies. Direct medical costs referring to the year 2014 were incorporated in the model. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for uncertainty and variation in the parameters of the model. Primary outcomes were patient survival (life-years), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total direct costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). RESULTS: The discounted quality-adjusted survival of patients treated with EVE plus EXE was greater by 0.035 and 0.004 QALYs, compared to BEV plus PACL and BEV plus CAPE, respectively. EVE plus EXE was the least costly treatment in terms of drug acquisition, administration, and concomitant medications. The total lifetime cost per patient was estimated at €55,022, €67,980, and €62,822 for EVE plus EXE, BEV plus PACL, and BEV plus CAPE, respectively. The probabilistic analysis confirmed the deterministic results. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that EVE plus EXE may be a dominant alternative relative to BEV plus PACL and BEV plus CAPE for the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced BC patients failing initial therapy with NSAIs.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, data-intensive AI, particularly the domain of natural language processing and understanding, has seen significant progress driven by the advent of large datasets and deep neural networks that have sidelined more classic AI approaches to the field. These systems can apparently demonstrate sophisticated linguistic understanding or generation capabilities, but often fail to transfer their skills to situations they have not encountered before. We argue that computational situated grounding provides a solution to some of these learning challenges by creating situational representations that both serve as a formal model of the salient phenomena, and contain rich amounts of exploitable, task-appropriate data for training new, flexible computational models. Our model reincorporates some ideas of classic AI into a framework of neurosymbolic intelligence, using multimodal contextual modeling of interactive situations, events, and object properties. We discuss how situated grounding provides diverse data and multiple levels of modeling for a variety of AI learning challenges, including learning how to interact with object affordances, learning semantics for novel structures and configurations, and transferring such learned knowledge to new objects and situations.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression (SR) - which learns symbolic equations to describe the underlying relation from input-output pairs - is widely used for scientific discovery. However, a rich set of scientific data from the real world (e.g., particle trajectories and astrophysics) are typically unsupervised, devoid of explicit input-output pairs. In this paper, we focus on symbolic implicit equation discovery, which aims to discover the mathematical relation from unsupervised data that follows an implicit equation f(𝐱 ) =0. However, due to the dense distribution of degenerate solutions (e.g., f(𝐱 )=x\\_{i}{-}{x}\\_{i}{)} in the discrete search space, most existing SR approaches customized for this task fail to achieve satisfactory performance. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel pre-training framework - namely, Pre-trained neural symbolic model for Implicit Equation (PIE) - to discover implicit equations from unsupervised data. The core idea is that, we formulate the implicit equation discovery on unsupervised scientific data as a translation task and utilize the prior learned from the pre-training dataset to infer non-degenerate skeletons of the underlying relation end-to-end. Extensive experiments shows that, leveraging the prior from a pre-trained language model, PIE effectively tackles the problem of degenerate solutions and significantly outperforms all the existing SR approaches. PIE shows an encouraging step towards general scientific discovery on unsupervised data.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Current approaches to video analysis of human motion focus on raw pixels or keypoints as the basic units of reasoning. We posit that adding higher-level motion primitives, which can capture natural coarser units of motion such as ``backswing '' or ``follow-through '' , can be used to improve downstream analysis tasks. This higher level of abstraction can also capture key features, such as loops of repeated primitives, that are currently inaccessible at lower levels of representation. We therefore introduce Motion Programs, a neuro-symbolic, program-like representation that expresses motions as a composition of high-level primitives. We also present a system for automatically inducing motion programs from videos of human motion and for leveraging motion programs in video synthesis. Experiments show that motion programs can accurately describe a diverse set of human motions and the inferred programs contain semantically meaningful motion primitives, such as arm swings and jumping jacks. Our representation also benefits downstream tasks such as video interpolation and video prediction and outperforms off-the-shelf models. We further demonstrate how these programs can detect diverse kinds of repetitive motion and facilitate interactive video editing.",

We extensively analyze various methodologies for incorporating domain knowledge, traffic rules, and commonsense reasoning into autonomous driving systems. The survey categorizes and analyzes approaches based on their knowledge representation and integration methods, ranging from purely symbolic to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. We examine recent developments in logic programming, foundation models for knowledge representation, reinforcement learning frameworks, and other emerging technologies incorporating domain knowledge. This work systematically reviews recent approaches, identifying key challenges, opportunities, and future research directions in knowledge-enhanced autonomous driving systems. Our analysis reveals emerging trends in the field, including the increasing importance of interpretable AI, the role of formal verification in safety-critical systems, and the potential of hybrid approaches that combine traditional knowledge representation with modern machine learning techniques.",

    "abstract": "Discernible patterns of a person's daily activities can be utilized to detect behavioral symptomatology of mental illness at early stages. Wearable Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices with sensors that collect motion data and provide objective measures of physical activity can help to better monitor and detect potential episodes related to the mental health conditions at earlier, more treatable stages. This research puts forward a neuro-symbolic model which uses learnable parameters with integrated knowledge for detection of depression episodes using IoMT based actigraphic input. A novel deep fuzzy model, Depress-DCNF is a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) where CNN is used to extract high-level features from the motor activity recordings which are eventually combined with the discriminative statistical features to produce an optimized feature map. This optimized feature map is finally used to train the ANFIS model which accurately performs the depression classification task. The model is validated on the Depresjon benchmark dataset and compares favorably to state-of-the-art approach giving a superior performance accuracy of 85.10%.(C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Adverse hypersensitivity reactions to natural foods and certain drugs and food additives are mediated by immunological (allergy) or non-immunological mechanisms. Some clinical and physiological similarities have been noted between these allergic and non-allergic reactions. This observation has led to the concept of \"pseudoallergic reactions-PAR\". PAR can be triggered in various ways such as: interactions with the central or peripherical nervous system, non-specific release of mediators, enzyme inhibition due to hereditary or pharmacologically induced enzyme deficiencies and pharmacological properties of some natural food constituents such as biogenic amines. The prevalence of adverse reactions to food additives has been calculated to be about 0.1%. PAR to food additives occurs frequently in patients suffering from urticaria, asthma and may be accompanied by history of aspirin or NSAI pseudoallergic reactions. The same additives (azo dyes, sulphites, benzoates) are used in various drug formulations and may be responsible for eliciting PAR. In Poland, labelling of food additives, following the \"E number system\", has been mandatory since 1993. Unfortunately, this satisfactory trend has not yet been applied to drug additives. The diagnosis of PAR to food additives is based on the anamnesis with analysis of the patient's drug and dietary intake. Skin tests and \"in vitro\" tests are only sporadically informative. In each individual patient, a specific challenge with additives is desirable. Food additives may be tested according to the schedule based on DBPCFC principle. Individually performed exclusion regimes are the principal methods of prevention.",

    "year": "2020",
    "author": "Kursuncu, Ugur and Gaur, Manas and Sheth, Amit",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Learning the underlying patterns in data goes beyond instance-based generalization to external knowledge represented in structured graphs or networks. Deep learning that primarily constitutes neural computing stream in AI has shown significant advances in probabilistically learning latent patterns using a multi-layered network of computational nodes (i.e., neurons/hidden units). Structured knowledge that underlies symbolic computing approaches and often supports reasoning, has also seen significant growth in recent years, in the form of broad-based (e.g., DBPedia, Yago) and domain, industry or application specific knowledge graphs. A common substrate with careful integration of the two will raise opportunities to develop neuro-symbolic learning approaches for AI, where conceptual and probabilistic representations are combined. As the incorporation of external knowledge will aid in supervising the learning of features for the model, deep infusion of representational knowledge from knowledge graphs within hidden layers will further enhance the learning process. Although much work remains, we believe that knowledge graphs will play an increasing role in developing hybrid neuro-symbolic intelligent systems (bottom-up deep learning with top-down symbolic computing) as well as in building explainable AI systems for which knowledge graphs will provide scaffolding for punctuating neural computing. In this position paper, we describe our motivation for such a neuro-symbolic approach and framework that combines knowledge graph and neural networks.",

    "abstract": "The task of policy compliance detection (PCD) is to determine if a scenario is in compliance with respect to a set of written policies. In a conversational setting, the results of PCD can indicate if clarifying questions must be asked to determine compliance status. Existing approaches usually claim to have reasoning capabilities that are latent or require a large amount of annotated data. In this work, we propose logical decomposition for policy compliance (LDPC): a neuro-symbolic framework to detect policy compliance using large language models (LLMs) in a few-shot setting. By selecting only a few exemplars alongside recently developed prompting techniques, we demonstrate that our approach soundly reasons about policy compliance conversations by extracting sub-questions to be answered, assigning truth values from contextual information, and explicitly producing a set of logic statements from the given policies. The formulation of explicit logic graphs can in turn help answer PCDrelated questions with increased transparency and explainability. We apply this approach to the popular PCD and conversational machine reading benchmark, ShARC, and show competitive performance with no task-specific finetuning. We also leverage the inherently interpretable architecture of LDPC to understand where errors occur, revealing ambiguities in the ShARC dataset and highlighting the challenges involved with reasoning for conversational question answering.",

    "year": "2022",
    "author": "Yun, Kyongsik and Lu, Thomas and Huyen, Alexander and Hammer, Patrick and Pei, Wang",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "There are two main algorithmic approaches to autonomous driving systems: (1) An end-to-end system in which a single deep neural network learns to map sensory input directly into appropriate warning and driving responses. (2) A mediated hybrid recognition system in which a system is created by combining independent modules that detect each semantic feature. While some researchers believe that deep learning can solve any problem, others believe that a more engineered and symbolic approach is needed to cope with complex environments with less data. Deep learning alone has achieved state-of-the-art results in many areas, from complex gameplay to predicting protein structures. In particular, in image classification and recognition, deep learning models have achieved accuracies as high as humans. But sometimes it can be very difficult to debug if the deep learning model doesn't work. Deep learning models can be vulnerable and are very sensitive to changes in data distribution. Generalization can be problematic. It's usually hard to prove why it works or doesn't. Deep learning models can also be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Here, we combine deep learning-based object recognition and tracking with an adaptive neurosymbolic network agent, called the Non-Axiomatic Reasoning System (NARS), that can adapt to its environment by building concepts based on perceptual sequences. We achieved an improved intersection-over-union (IOU) object recognition performance of 0.65 in the adaptive retraining model compared to IOU 0.31 in the COCO data pre-trained model. We improved the object detection limits using RADAR sensors in a simulated environment, and demonstrated the weaving car detection capability by combining deep learning-based object detection and tracking with a neurosymbolic model.",

This requires combining heterogeneous data sources such as knowledge graphs, neural model predictions, structured databases, crowd-sourced data, and many more. To allow for such reasoning, we generalise the standard rule-based language Datalog with existential rules (commonly referred to as tuple-generating dependencies) to the fuzzy setting, by allowing for arbitrary t-norms in the place of classical conjunctions in rule bodies. The resulting formalism allows us to perform reasoning about data associated with degrees of uncertainty while preserving computational complexity results and the applicability of reasoning techniques established for the standard Datalog setting. In particular, we provide fuzzy extensions of Datalog chases which produce fuzzy universal models and we exploit them to show that in important fragments of the language, reasoning has the same complexity as in the classical setting.",

    "abstract": "716 cases collected from 9 recent studies published between 1981 and 1985 served as a basis for a general review of the current treatment of temporal arteritis. Steroid therapy was instituted as first intention in 652 cases, high dose treatment was continued for between 8 days and 3 months but the majority of authors started a reduction in the dosage from the 4th or 5th week. There was no overall agreement regarding the duration of maintenance therapy nor the criteria allowing its discontinuation, and withdrawal was not possible before the 25th month on average. The ideal initial dosage, in the absence of randomized studies, remains to be defined: generally around 0.5 mg/kg/d in milder forms, the dosage may be increased to 1 mg/kg/d in the presence of complicated temporal arteritis. Besides cortico steroid therapy, other treatments are successively envisaged: synthetic anti-malarials (SAM), non steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAI), dapsone... while these are generally used as back-up treatment, David-Chausse used SAM as first intention, combined in 17 cases with NSAI in 61 of his 66 patients, with very promising results which require confirmation in other studies. In this review the cure rate was around 25% and the relapse rate 38%; complications related to the disease occurred in 19%, while almost one patient in two-47%-developed iatrogenic complications. Blindness dominates the prognosis, and occurred in 15% of cases, most often as an inaugural event, it very rarely regressed on steroid treatment. Although death occurred in 18% of cases, the prognosis of temporal arteritis generally remains favorable, with a 5 year survival curve identical to a control population.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines a possible interaction between non-steroid antiinflammatory drugs (NSAI drugs) and renal lithium clearance in conscious, unoperated rats with diabetes insipidus (Brattleboro strain) and ordinary Wistar rats. The drugs were given with the food for 5 days before clearance determination in the following daily does per kg body weight: acetylsalicylic acid 115 mg/kg, phenylbutazone 20 mg/kg, indomethacin 5 mg/kg, and penicillamine 65 mg/kg. None of the drugs affected the lithium clearance. Also urine flow, sodium clearance, potassium clearance, and prostaglandin E2 excretion remained unaffected by the treatments. The results suggest that a continued lowering of lithium clearance cannot be produced, at least not by administration of the drugs with the food. Since lithium clearance is a quantitative measure of the delivery of tubular fluid from the proximal tubules to the loop of Henle, the results also suggest that chronic administration of NSAI drugs does not influence delivery from the proximal tubules in rats. The lowering of lithium clerance observed by others after administration of the drugs by injection or by gastric tube may have been transient, lasting only for a short period after each administration.",

Material and methods. A total of 97 patients aged 65-85 years with stage II-IV OA by Kellgren-Lawrence received CS treatment. ne treatment efficacy was assessed by functional Lecken's index, pain intensity at walking and rest, general functional condition, need in nonsteroid anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs. Standardization was achieved with visual analogue scale (VAS). Results. Positive effects (pain relief, better functional parameters, lower intake of NSAI drugs) were more pronounced and stable in patients with OA stage 1 and 2. In OA of stage 3 and 4, a beneficial effect of a 6-month CS course was unstable. Side effects were at the level of mean statistics. Conclusion. CS (structum) is recommended for treatment of OA stage 1-4 by Kellgren-Lawrence. Duration of the treatment depends on severity of x-ray symptoms of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Rapid extraction of higher-order rules from sequences of items and their immediate application to construction of novel sequences is a challenging task for neural networks. One of the mechanisms that allows to capture hierarchical dependencies between items within sequences is ordinal coding. Ordinal patterns create a grammar, or a set of rules, that reduces the dimensionality of the search space and that can be used in a generative manner to compose new sequences. Using this framework, we propose a sample-efficient and lightweight neuro-symbolic architecture that uses ordinal codes in a generative manner, adhering to the principle of compositionality. The higher-order rules are extracted and learned in a one-shot manner, and allow to extrapolate sequences of items from the given repertoire. We demonstrate how this framework can be used to make the solver robust to exponentially growing complexity of the given task by reducing its dimensionality.",

However, the current HD computing is ineffective in extracting high-level feature information for image data. In this paper, we present a neuro-symbolic approach called NSHD, which integrates CNNs and Hyperdimensional (HD) learning techniques to provide efficient learning with state-of-the-art quality. We devise the HD training procedure, which fully integrates knowledge from the deep learning model through a distillation process with optimized computation costs due to the integration. Our experimental results show that NSHD provides high energy efficiency as compared to CNN, e.g., up to 64% with comparable accuracy, and can outperform the learning quality when more computing resources are allowed. We also show the symbolic nature of the NSHD can make the learning humnan-interpretable by exploiting the property of HD computing.",

    "abstract": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have revolutionized various industries and aspects of the digital world in several ways. Built on blockchain technology, NFTs provide a secure and transparent way to establish ownership and provenance of unique digital or physical items. This has wide-ranging implications, from art and collectibles to virtual real estate and digital goods. While NFTs offer many benefits, however, they also raise concerns, including environmental impacts due to energyintensive blockchain networks, copyright and plagiarism issues, and speculative bubbles in the NFT market. In this work, we collected 200,000 tweets about NFTs and employed state-of-theart neurosymbolic AI tools to better understand what are the online conversation drivers and sentiments around NFTs and, hence, gain insights about what makes them valuable.",

    "abstract": "Sequential problems are ubiquitous in AI, such as in reinforcement learning or natural language processing. State-of-the-art deep sequential models, like transformers, excel in these settings but fail to guarantee the satisfaction of constraints necessary for trustworthy deployment. In contrast, neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) provides a sound formalism to enforce constraints in deep probabilistic models but scales exponentially on sequential problems. To overcome these limitations, we introduce relational neurosymbolic Markov models (NeSy-MMs), a new class of end-to-end differentiable sequential models that integrate and provably satisfy relational logical constraints. We propose a strategy for inference and learning that scales on sequential settings, and that combines approximate Bayesian inference, automated reasoning, and gradient estimation. Our experiments show that NeSy-MMs can solve problems beyond the current state-of-the-art in neurosymbolic AI and still provide strong guarantees with respect to desired properties. Moreover, we show that our models are more interpretable and that constraints can be adapted at test time to out-of-distribution scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The article considers the problem of the accuracy of detection of intrusions in software systems based on deep learning neural networks. An example of a system for detecting botnets, i.e., malicious software, which are the source of potential attacks, including Denial of Service (DDoS), is presented. The system is created as a classification model that detects the behavior of botnets on infected resources. A number of experiments were conducted on the open data set of the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. To increase the accuracy of the classification, the method of augmentating the data set using the method of generating examples of adversarial attacks was used. A method for verification of the reliability of a neural network using automatic proof of the robustness property of the model based on SMT solvers is presented. To increase the accuracy of attack detection, a neurosymbolic approach that combines algebraic methods with classification models is also considered.",

    "abstract": "The immunosuppressive effect of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and its 15,000 dalton envelope protein (p15E) were studied to determine if the mechanism of action was due to an increase in prostaglandin production. We examined the effects of exogenous PGE1 and PGE2 on the normal Con A response of feline peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and found them to be inhibitory. The addition of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin to cells incubated with FeLV or FeLV p15E and Con A completely abrogated the viral suppressive effects. This reversal was titratable and time-dependent. Other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs were found to have similar actions. Indomethacin was also able to increase the suppressed Con A response of PBL from FeLV-infected cats. Upon measurement of PGE2 levels from PBL cultured with FeLV, we found a decrease in PGE2 accumulation associated with FeLV presence during the first 24 h of culture. These findings indicate that FeLV does not cause its immunosuppressive effects by increasing PG production and suggests that indomethacin and the other tested NSAI drugs do not produce their effect by PG inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The endoscopic appearance of duodenitis is a common finding in patients undergoing endoscopy because of epigastric pain however, the relationship of the visual findings to histology is poorly defined. We set out to ascertain if there was a correlation between the endoscopic and histological appearances of the duodenal mucosa. Consecutive patients with epigastric pain referred for diagnostic gastroduodenoscopy were studied. The visual appearances of 'duodenitis' (erythema, erosions and sub-epithelial haemorrhage) were reported independently by two endoscopists. Duodenal biopsies were taken and assessed for: neutrophil infiltrate, mononuclear infiltrate, gastric metaplasia, villous atrophy and a breach in the mucosa. H pylori status was determined. Of the 93 patients with endoscopic features of duodenitis an increase in histological markers of inflammation was found in 75 (81%). However, histological inflammation was absent or minimal in 68 (73%). Conversely, biopsies from normal-looking mucosa revealed histological evidence of inflammation in 26 (27%). For patients with the endoscopic features of duodenitis the positive & negative predictive value for neutrophilic infiltrate was 39% and 98% respectively. Biopsies from erosions confirmed a breach in the mucosa in only 2 of 40 patients. Neutrophilic infiltrate occurred with NSAI ingestion and infection with H pylori. The endoscopic appearance of the duodenal mucosa is unreliable in determining the presence of histological inflammation. The endoscopic appearance of 'erosions' is not usually associated with a mucosal breach.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Everolimus has been shown to be an effective HR+/HER2- mBC treatment in both clinical trials and real-world practice. The current study aims at understanding factors associated with everolimus use and how it is used in the real world. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted among postmenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC women who received everolimus, endocrine therapy (ET), or chemotherapy (CT) for mBC between 1 July 2012 and 15 April 2013 after an NSAI failure. Factors associated with everolimus use versus ET or CT were identified using multivariable logistic regressions. Reasons for prescribing everolimus and everolimus treatment patterns were described. RESULTS: Liver metastasis and high tumor volume were associated with a higher likelihood of everolimus use versus ET (OR = 1.67, OR = 1.62) but a lower likelihood of everolimus use versus CT (OR = 0.43, OR = 0.30). Medicare-only insurance (OR = 0.30) as well as ECOG ≥2 (OR = 3.72) and prior CT in mBC (OR = 2.76) were associated with a lower and higher likelihood of everolimus use versus CT, respectively. The top reason for prescribing everolimus was efficacy (69-85%). About 15% and 29% of everolimus users in second line and third line or above received prior CT for mBC. Exemestane was the most common concomitant therapy with everolimus (56-87%). The majority of patients initiated everolimus at the labeled dose of 10 mg daily (>80%) and maintained this dose (>80%). CONCLUSIONS: In the real world, everolimus was used in more severe patients than ET but less severe patients than CT based on visceral metastasis, tumor volume, and performance status. The top reason for prescribing everolimus was efficacy. A large proportion of patients received first or second line CT before everolimus initiation. The majority of patients used everolimus according to the labeled combination and dose. Future studies are needed to determine optimal sequencing of everolimus, ET, and CT for HR+/HER2- mBC.",

    "abstract": "In a recent work [ Q. Li and S. Evje, Netw. Heterog. Media, , 18 (2023), pp. 48-79], it was explored how to identify the unknown flux function in a one-dimensional scalar conservation law. Key ingredients are symbolic neural networks to represent the candidate flux functions, entropy-satisfying numerical schemes, and a proper combination of initial data. The purpose of this work is to extend this methodology to a two-dimensional scalar conservation law ( * ) u(t) + f(u)(x) + g(u)(y) = 0. Straightforward extension of the method from the 1D to the 2D problem results in poor identification of the unknown f(u) and g(u). Relying on ideas from joint and alternating equations training, a learning strategy is designed that enables accurate identification of the flux functions, even when 2D observations are sparse. It involves an alternating flux training approach where a first set of candidate flux functions obtained from joint training is improved through an alternating direction-dependent training strategy. Numerical investigations demonstrate that the method can effectively identify the true underlying flux functions f and g in the general case when they are nonconvex and unequal.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in utilizing deep learning-based techniques to predict solutions to various partial differential equations. In this study, we investigate the identification of an unknown flux function and diffusion coefficient in a one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation. The diffusion function is allowed to vanish on intervals implying that solutions generally possess low regularity, i.e., are discontinuous. Therefore, solutions must be interpreted in the sense of entropy solutions which combine a weak formulation with an additional constraint (entropy condition). We explore a methodology that utilizes symbolic neural networks (S-Nets) in combination with an entropy-consistent discrete numerical scheme (ECDNS). Different types of observation data are explored. Extensive experiments in this paper demonstrate that the proposed method is a robust tool to identify the unknown flux and diffusion function. The flux and diffusion functions are restricted to be rational functions.",

    "abstract": "In contemporary research, neural networks are being used to derive Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) from observations. However, parameterized ODEs pose a more significant challenge than non-parameterized ODEs since the networks are required to understand the roles of the parameters, i.e., the structure of the equations. This paper proposes a novel approach by combining Symbolic Neural Network (S-Net) with ODE Solver to solve this issue. First, S-Net learns the structure of the parameterized ODEs and then predicts the dynamics based on the new parameters with the new initial states. To assess its performance, we compare our approach with a widely used Ordinary Neural Network (O-Net) that directly learns and predicts ODEs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms O-Net when applied to the Lotka-Volterra and Lorenz equations.",

    "year": "2023",
    "author": "Li, Qing and Jiahui, Geng and Steinar, Evje",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Machine learning methods have in various ways emerged as a useful tool for modeling the dynamics of physical systems in the context of partial differential equations (PDEs). Nonlinear conservation laws (NCLs) of the form u(t)+f(u)(x) = 0 play a vital role within the family of PDEs. A main challenge with NCLs is that solutions contain discontinuities. That is, one or several jumps of the form (u(L)(t), u(R)(t)) with u(L) not equal u(R) may move in space and time such that information about f (u) in the interval associated with this jump is not present in the observation data. Moreover, the lack of regularity in the solution u(x, t) prevents use of physics informed neural network (PINN) and similar methods. The purpose of this work is to propose a method to identify the nonlinear flux function f(u, beta)with variable parameters of an unknown scalar conservation law u(t) + f(u, beta)(x) = 0 ( * ) with u as the dependent variable and beta as the parameter. In a recent work we introduced a framework coined ConsLaw-Net that combines a symbolic multi-layer neural network and an entropy-satisfying discrete scheme to learn the nonlinear, unknown flux function f(u; beta) for various fixed beta. Learning the flux function with variable parameters, marked as f(u, beta), is more challenging since it requires an understanding of the relationship between the variable u and parameter beta as well. In this work we demonstrate how to couple ConsLaw-Net to the Linear Regression Neural Network (LRNN) to learn the functional form of the two variable function f(u, beta). In addition, ConsLaw-Net is here further developed and made more generic by using a refined discrete scheme combined with a more general symbolic neural network (S-Net). We experimentally demonstrate that the upgraded ConsLaw-Net integrated with LRNN is well-suited for learning tasks, achieving more accurate identification than existing learning approaches when applied to problems that involve general classes of flux functions f(u, beta). The investigations of this work are restricted to the class of polynomial, rational functions. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

    "author": "Li, Tao and Zhu, Quanyan",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools. In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges associated with FMs and their application in the domain of cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Sounds (IoS) combines sound sensing, processing, and transmission techniques, enabling collaboration among diverse sound devices. To achieve a perceptual quality of sound synchronization in the IoS, it is necessary to precisely synchronize three critical factors: sound quality, timing, and behavior control. However, conventional bit-oriented communication, which focuses on bit reproduction, may not be able to fulfill these synchronization requirements under dynamic channel conditions. One promising approach to address the synchronization challenges of the IoS is relying on semantic communication (SC) that can capture and leverage the logical relationships in its source data. Consequently, in this article, we propose an IoS-centric SC framework with a transceiver design. The designed encoder extracts semantic information from diverse sources by leveraging neuro-symbolic AI and then transmits it to IoS listeners. For low-bandwidth scenarios, the encoder selectively distills important semantic information to reduce transmission latency for timing synchronization. At the receiver's end, the decoder reconstructs sounds and integrates them by leveraging semantic-aware reasoning, which helps achieve sound quality synchronization. Moreover, we present simulation results in a case study to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Finally, we explore several open issues on mathematical models, resource allocation, and cross-layer protocols.",

    "abstract": "The fault diagnosis of the trolley mechanism in ship-to-shore cranes (STSCs) plays a critical role in guaranteeing the stability and safety of the container handling at the port. The existing models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved slight success in the fault diagnosis of the trolley mechanism in the STSC system. Nevertheless, due to the black box characteristics of DNNs, these diagnostic models cannot provide a reasonable explanation for their decisions. Based on the predictions made by DNNs, it is yet challenging for experts to make informed and trustworthy decisions. To address this, this article proposes a knowledge-based reverse deep belief network (KBRDBN) to build an efficient neural-symbolic system capable of interpreting feature learning and reasoning of DNNs. In KBRDBN, two types of relational knowledge (i.e., confidence and soft rules) are extracted. Confidence rules can explain how the deep belief network (DBN) works and produce a latent feature for raw vibration signals of the trolley mechanism. Soft rules can denote inherent uncertainty and conduct quantitative reasoning for the diagnostic decisions of the trolley mechanism. The experimental study on a testbed demonstrates the remarkable performance of the proposed approach in interpretability, uncertainty-handling capability, and fault recognition of the trolley mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Fan fault diagnosis in steelmaking production lines is critical for safety production and environmental protection. Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve slight success for fan fault diagnosis. These models are unable to provide explanations for fan diagnostic decisions due to DNN's opaque structure. From the perspective of neural-symbolic integration, researchers gradually pay attention to how to extract relational knowledge from DNNs to provide an explainable representation of DNN's features learning and reasoning. This study introduces a neural-symbolic model, reverse deep belief network (ReDBN), where interpretable logic representations (CR-rules) are derived based on the integration of confidence and rough rules so as to tackle fan uncertain diagnosis decision-making. To extract confidence rules, a k -logic restricted Boltzmann machine ( k -LRBM) is deployed and evaluated. In k -LRBMs, confidence rules can be extracted by considering the effect of k different literal clusters on neuron's activation. Besides, this article introduces a symbolic language, termed rough rules, which can solve uncertain reasoning during fan fault diagnosis. Rough rules, assigning a belief value for attribute variables, can represent the probability of how likely the sample belongs to specific fault labels. Verified on two fan datasets from a fan testbed and a real production site in Shanghai, ReDBN can achieve better performance than other typical models.",

    "abstract": "Fault diagnosis of the fan in steelmaking shops has significant practical value in guaranteeing smooth operation and achieving quality control of steel coils. The existing data-driven systems, mainly deep neural network-based diagnostic models, have achieved some success in recognizing fan faults. However, these models face a significant challenge in reaching reliable diagnostic conclusions with uncertainty due to the absence of interpretable representations between fault labels and features. To address this issue, this paper develops and evaluates an interpretable model, namely Stacked Logic Denoising Auto-Encoders (SLDAE). SLDAE is a flexible neural-symbolic system that extracts confidence rules and Binary Decision Logic (BDL) rules to explain how SDAE conducts feature learning, and conducts uncertain reasoning of diagnostic decision-making. To extract confidence rules, a logic grouping DAE is designed to consider the impact of different literals on neuron activation so as to reduce information loss. To extract BDL rules, we design a novel network structure, Discrete Logic Networks (DLNs), to facilitate extracting implicit relationships between fault features and labels while learning and representing the belief of BDL rules. Experiments verified on two fan datasets indicate that SLDAE can perform quantitative reasoning of uncertain diagnostic logic and exhibits a notable performance in fault recognition.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Background: Low back pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended as the first-line pharmaco logic therapy for subacute or chronic low back pain, with opioids reserved for patients who fail on NSAIDs. CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 genes have variants that place patients using analgesics at risk for adverse events. However, precision medicine based on pharmacogenetically informed prescribing is becoming more feasible as genotyping costs decline. This study aims to compare opioids vs NSAI Ds in treating adults with subacute or chronic low back pain under the alternative models of usual care and precision medicine. Methods: An observational cohort study within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation (PRECISION) will be used to simulate a randomized controlled trial. Patients using opioids and NSAIDs will be optimally matched at baseline using propensity scores. A saliva sample will also be collected to determine patient genotypes for drug metabolism based on CYP2D6 (single-gene model) and CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 (multigene model). Prescribing that is concordant with pharmacogenetically informed care under these models will be considered ``low risk '' , whereas discordant prescribing will be considered ``high risk '' . Primary outcomes will be assessed over 6 months using a Numerical Rating Scale for pain, the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and the Drug Adverse Events Index. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using quality-of-life measures. An estimated 600 patients will be enrolled to acquire at least 400 patients after attrition and allowing for unmatched patients. This will achieve a statistical power of at least 80% in detecting the effect sizes ranging from 0.35 (small-medium effect) to 0.69 (medium-large effect). Discussion: This PRECISION Pain Research Registry study builds on the concepts espoused in the Precision Medicine Initiative and addresses long-term goals established by the National Institutes of Health by assessing how precision medicine may prevent and treat chronic pain.",

SATyrus provides a logical declarative language used to specify and compile a target problem into a particidar energy function representing its space state of solutions. The resulting energy function is then mapped into a Higher-order Hopfield network of stochastic neurons in order to find its global minima. The application of SATyrus over three illustrative problems are given: (i) graph coloring, (ii) Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), and (iii) calculus of the difference between observed and hypothesized distances of two atoms, a sub-problem of the determination of a molecular structure.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the non-transparent computing process of deep learning has become a significant reason hindering its further development. The Neural-Symbolic (NS) system formed by integrating logic rules into neural networks has attracted increasing attention owing to its direct interpretability. Embedding symbolic logical formulas into a low-dimensional continuous space provides an effective way for the NS system. However, current studies are all constrained by the modeling ability for its syntactic structure and fail to preserve the intrinsic semantics in embeddings, which causes poor performance on downstream reasoning tasks. To this end, this paper proposes a novel method of Contrastive Graph Representations (ConGR) for logical formulas embedding. First, to improve the modeling ability for the syntactic structure, ConGR introduces a densely connected graph convolutional network (GCN) with an attention mechanism to process syntax parsing graphs of formulas. In this way, discriminative local and global embeddings of formulas are obtained at the syntax level. Second, the contrastive instances (positive or negative) for each anchor formula are generated by the transformation under the guidance of logical properties. To preserve semantic information, two types of contrast, global-local and global-global, are carried out to refine formula embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConGR obtains superior performance against state-of-the-art baselines on entailment checking and premise selection datasets.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Humanoid robots, with the potential to perform a broad range of tasks in environments designed for humans, have been deemed crucial for the basis of general AI agents. When talking about planning and controlling, although traditional models and task-specific methods have been extensively studied over the past few decades, they are inadequate for achieving the flexibility and versatility needed for general autonomy. Learning approaches, especially reinforcement learning, are powerful and popular nowadays, but they are inherently \"blind\" during training, relying heavily on trials in simulation without proper guidance from physical principles or underlying dynamics. In response, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline that seamlessly integrates perception, planning, and model-based control for humanoid robot walking. We refer to our method as iWalker, which is driven by imperative learning (IL), a self-supervising neuro-symbolic learning framework. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, significantly improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. In experiments, iWalker demonstrates effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward versatile and autonomous humanoid robots.",

    "abstract": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) constitute a crucial component of neural symbolic music generation, among which some works have yielded outstanding results and attracted considerable attention. Nevertheless, previous VAEs still encounter issues with overly long feature sequences and generated results lack contextual coherence, thus the challenge of modeling long multi-track symbolic music still remains unaddressed. To this end, we propose Multi-view MidiVAE, as one of the pioneers in VAE methods that effectively model and generate long multi-track symbolic music. The Multi-view MidiVAE utilizes the two-dimensional (2-D) representation, OctupleMIDI, to capture relationships among notes while reducing the feature sequences length. Moreover, we focus on instrumental characteristics and harmony as well as global and local information about the musical composition by employing a hybrid variational encoding-decoding strategy to integrate both Track- and Bar-view MidiVAE features. Objective and subjective experimental results on the CocoChorales dataset demonstrate that, compared to the baseline, Multi-view MidiVAE exhibits significant improvements in terms of modeling long multi-track symbolic music.",

These knowledge graphs serve as intuitive repositories of human knowledge, allowing for the inference of new information. However, traditional symbolic reasoning, while powerful in its own right, faces challenges posed by incomplete and noisy data in the knowledge graphs. In contrast, recent years have witnessed the emergence of Neural Symbolic AI, an exciting development that fuses the capabilities of deep learning and symbolic reasoning. It aims to create AI systems that are not only highly interpretable and explainable but also incredibly versatile, effectively bridging the gap between symbolic and neural approaches. Furthermore, with the advent of large language models, the integration of LLMs with knowledge graph reasoning has emerged as a prominent frontier, offering the potential to unlock unprecedented capabilities. This tutorial aims to comprehensively review different aspects of knowledge graph reasoning applications and also introduce the recent advances about Neural Symbolic reasoning and combining knowledge graph reasoning with large language models.

    "abstract": "At present, it is very important to realize efficient and flexible data sharing and access while ensuring information security. As a new cryptography technology, visual cryptography provides a new solution for image sharing and encryption. This paper discusses the application of image sharing and encryption based on visual cryptography in NSAI (Networking Systems of AI), and gives the methods and steps of shared image preprocessing in detail. From the experimental simulation results, the MSE of the proposed algorithm is low, only 4.16. The low MSE value shows that the algorithm is effective in denoising, and it can effectively remove noise while maintaining the important features of the image. At the same time, the data transmission security, data storage security and key management security of this method are all high. This shows that the information security protection scheme using this method has high security. This study provides a new image sharing and encryption method to improve the level of information security and privacy protection; At the same time, it expands the application scope of visual cryptography in NSAI, promotes the development of NSAI, and provides reference for future research in related fields.",

    "abstract": "Neural module network (NMN) based methods have shown promising performance in visual question answering (VQA). However, existing methods have overlooked the potential existence of multiple reasoning paths for a given question. They generate one reasoning path for a question, which restricts the diversity in module combinations. Additionally, these methods generate reasoning paths solely based on questions, neglecting visual cues, which may lead to sub-optimal paths in multistep reasoning scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Visual-Guided Neural Module Network (V-NMN), a neuro-symbolic method that integrates visual information to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we utilize the reasoning capability of large language models (LLM) to generate all feasible reasoning paths for the questions in a few-shot manner. Then, we assess the suitability of these paths for the image and select the optimal one based on the assessment. The final answer is derived by executing the reasoning process along the selected path. We evaluate our method on the GQA dataset and CX-GQA, a test set that requires multi-step reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.",

    "year": "2023",
    "author": "Liyana, Farah and Saratha, Sathasivam and Majahar, Ali Majid Khan",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This study presents a new way of increasing 3SAT logic programming's efficiency in the Hopfield network. A new model of merging fuzzy logic with 3SAT in the Hopfield network is presented called HNN-3SATFuzzy. The hybridised dynamic model can avoid locally minimal solutions and lessen the computing burden by utilising fuzzification and defuzzification techniques in fuzzy logic. In addressing the 3SAT issue, the proposed hybrid approach can select neuron states between zero and one. Aside from that, unsatisfied neuron clauses will be changed using the alpha-cut method as a defuzzifier step until the correct neuron state is determined. The defuzzification process is a mapping stage that converts a fuzzy value into a crisp output. The corrected neuron state using alpha-cut in the defuzzification stage is either sharpening up to one or sharpening down to zero. A simulated data collection was utilised to evaluate the hybrid techniques' performance. In the training phase, the network for HNN-3SATFuzzy was weighed using RMSE, SSE, MAE and MAPE metrics. The energy analysis also considers the ratio of global minima and processing period to assess its robustness. The findings are significant because this model considerably impacts Hopfield networks' capacity to handle 3SAT problems with less complexity and speed. The new information and ideas will aid in developing innovative ways to gather knowledge for future research in logic programming. Furthermore, the breakthrough in dynamic learning is considered a significant step forward in neuro-symbolic integration.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neural networks promote a distributed representation with no clear place for symbols. Despite this, we propose that symbols are manufactured simply by training a sparse random noise as a self-sustaining attractor in a feedback spiking neural network. This way, we can generate many of what we shall call prime attractors, and the networks that support them are like registers holding a symbolic value, and we call them registers. Like symbols, prime attractors are atomic and devoid of any internal structure. Moreover, the winner-take-all mechanism naturally implemented by spiking neurons enables registers to recover a prime attractor within a noisy signal. Using this faculty, when considering two connected registers, an input one and an output one, it is possible to bind in one shot using a Hebbian rule the attractor active on the output to the attractor active on the input. Thus, whenever an attractor is active on the input, it induces its bound attractor on the output; even though the signal gets blurrier with more bindings, the winner-take-all filtering faculty can recover the bound prime attractor. However, the capacity is still limited. It is also possible to unbind in one shot, restoring the capacity taken by that binding. This mechanism serves as a basis for working memory, turning prime attractors into variables. Also, we use a random second-order network to amalgamate the prime attractors held by two registers to bind the prime attractor held by a third register to them in one shot, de facto implementing a hash table. Furthermore, we introduce the register switch box composed of registers to move the content of one register to another. Then, we use spiking neurons to build a toy symbolic computer based on the above. The technics used suggest ways to design extrapolating, reusable, sample-efficient deep learning networks at the cost of structural priors.",

    "abstract": "Everolimus combined with exemestane is an important treatment option for patients suffering from estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, advanced breast cancer (ABC) who have been previously treated with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). After presentation of phase III registration trial BOLERO-2, several phase IIIb trials have been started to evaluate this regimen in a more real-world setting. Here, we review the efficacy and safety data published or presented at selected international meetings. These studies confirmed the outcome observed in the BOLERO-2 trial. Patient acceptance rate is also discussed by focusing on the permanent everolimus discontinuation rate in these trials. Factors influencing the safety profile are also reported, including the impact of age. The optimal sequence of combined therapy approaches associating targeted and endocrine therapy (ET) has yet to be determined as new treatment options such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors become available. However, everolimus-exemestane remains an important treatment option with a major impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and an acceptable safety profile.",

The median OS was not reached in the ribociclib arm in the protocol-specified final analysis; we hence performed an exploratory OS and additional outcomes analysis with an extended follow-up (median, 53.5 months). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive ET [goserelin plus nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) or tamoxifen] with ribociclib or placebo. OS was evaluated with a stratified Cox proportional hazard model and summarized with Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population included 672 patients. Median OS was 58.7 months with ribociclib versus 48.0 months with placebo [hazard ratio = 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.96]. Kaplan-Meier estimated OS at 48 months was 60% and 50% with ribociclib and placebo, respectively. Subgroup analyses were generally consistent with the OS benefit, including patients who received NSAI and patients aged less than 40 years. Subsequent antineoplastic therapies following discontinuation were balanced between the ribociclib (77%) and placebo (78%) groups. Use of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors after discontinuation was higher with placebo (26%) versus ribociclib (13%). Time to first chemotherapy was significantly delayed with ribociclib versus placebo. No drug-drug interactions were observed between ribociclib and either NSAI. CONCLUSIONS: Ribociclib plus ET continued to show significantly longer OS than ET alone in pre-/perimenopausal patients, including patients aged less than 40 years, with HR+/HER2- ABC with 53.5 months of median follow-up (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02278120).",

    "abstract": "3D human reconstruction is an important technology connecting the real world and the virtual world, but most of previous work needs expensive computing resources, making it difficult in real-time scenarios. We propose a lightweight human body reconstruction system based on parametric model, which employs only one RGBD camera as input. To generate a human model end to end, we build a fast and lightweight deep-learning network named Fast Body Net (FBN). The network pays more attention on the face and hands to enrich the local details. Additionally, we train a denoising auto-encoder to reduce unreasonable states of human model. Due to the lack of human dataset based on RGBD images, we propose an Indoor-Human dataset to train the network, which contains a total of 2500 frames of action data of five actors collected by Azure Kinect camera. Depth images avoid using RGB to extract depth features, which makes FBN lightweight and high-speed in reconstructing parametric human model. Qualitative and quantitative analysis on experimental results show that our method can improve at least 57% in efficiency with similar accuracy, as compared to state-of-the-art methods. Through our study, it is also demonstrated that consumer-grade RGBD cameras can provide great applications in real-time display and interaction for virtual reality.",

    "abstract": "Background This study provides an indirect treatment comparison of ribociclib combined with non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors and ovarian function suppression (ribociclib + NSAI + OFS) vs. a frequently used treatment option in German clinical routine (tamoxifen +/- OFS) in premenopausal patients with HR-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) early breast cancer (BC). Material and Methods Data on premenopausal women treated with ribociclib and tamoxifen were derived from the NATALEE clinical trial (NCT03701334) and the retrospective German data collection CLEAR-B, respectively. NATALEE trial eligibility criteria were applied to the CLEAR-B dataset. Standardized mortality ratio weights were used for propensity score (PS) adjustment to balance study populations. All hazard ratios (HR) were calculated based on a 4-year-observation period for both treatment arms. Effectiveness endpoints comprised invasive and distant disease-free survival (iDFS, dDFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS). Safety-related endpoints were treatment termination (TT) and toxicity-related TT (TTtox). For safety comparisons, the ribociclib arm was divided into groups that discontinued ribociclib + NSAI + OFS or ribociclib only. Results Significant beneficial effects favoring ribociclib + NSAI + OFS (n = 1115) over tamoxifen +/- OFS (n = 822) were observed for all effectiveness outcomes (iDFS [ HR = 0.5 (95% CI 0.35; 0.71); p < 0.01]; dDFS [ HR = 0.52 (95% CI 0.35; 0.77); p = 0.01], RFS [ HR = 0.42 (95% CI 0.29; 0.62); p < 0.01], OS [ HR = 0.34 (95% CI 0.18; 0.63); p = 0.01]) during the 4-year-observation period. The effect of early treatment discontinuation showed no significant differences between ribociclib + NSAI + OFS and tamoxifen +/- OFS (TT-a: HR = 1.2 [ 95% CI: 0.71; 2.01], p = 0.48; TTtox-a: HR = 0.54 [ 95% CI 0.22; 1.30], p = 0.23). Conclusion In this retrospective analysis, ribociclib + NSAI + OFS demonstrated advantages across all effectiveness endpoints, including OS, in premenopausal women with HR+, HER2- early BC, without increasing overall treatment discontinuation rates compared to tamoxifen +/- OFS.",

    "abstract": "BRAWO, a real-world study, assessed the efficacy, quality of life (QoL) and safety of EVE + EXE in postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer (ABC) in routine clinical practice. Postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2-ABC with recurrence or progression after a NSAI were included. Primary Observation parameters included the evaluation of the effectiveness of EVE + EXE. A multivariate-analysis using Cox proportional hazard model was built to identify predictors of progression. Overall, 2100 patients were enrolled (August 2012-December 2017); 2074 were evaluable for efficacy and safety analyses. Majority of patients (60.6%) received EVE + EXE as first (28.7%) or second-line (31.9%) therapy. Visceral metastases were present in 54.1% patients. Median progression-free survival (mPFS) reported as 6.6 months (95%CI: 6.3-7.0). Multivariate-analysis in a subset of patients (n = 1837) found higher body mass index (BMI) and non-visceral metastases to be independent predictors of favorable PFS. Patients with a BMI of 20 to <25 had a mPFS of 6.0 (95%CI: 5.4-6.4) and those with a BMI >= 30 had mPFS of 8.5 (95%CI: 6.9-9.9). 41.2% patients achieved stable disease and 7.3% partial response. No major changes were observed QoL; 86.4% patients received stomatitis prophylaxis and 41.4% experienced EVE related AEs of stomatitis, mainly low grade. AEs occurred in 91.2% of patients, of which stomatitis (42.6%) and fatigue (19.8%) were most frequent. The BRAWO study provides real-world evidence of efficacy and safety of EVE + EXE in patients with HR+, HER2- ABC. A high BMI and the absence of visceral metastases were independent predictors of PFS in this cohort of patients.",

However, while being rich in information, graphs are often noisy and incomplete. As a result, graph completion tasks, such as node classification or link prediction, have gained attention. On one hand, neural methods, such as graph neural networks, have proven to be robust tools for learning rich representations of noisy graphs. On the other hand, symbolic methods enable exact reasoning on graphs.We propose Knowledge Enhanced Graph Neural Networks (KeGNN), a neuro-symbolic framework for graph completion that combines both paradigms as it allows for the integration of prior knowledge into a graph neural network model.Essentially, KeGNN consists of a graph neural network as a base upon which knowledge enhancement layers are stacked with the goal of refining predictions with respect to prior knowledge.We instantiate KeGNN in conjunction with two state-of-the-art graph neural networks, Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, and evaluate KeGNN on multiple benchmark datasets for node classification.",

    "abstract": "To create usable and deployable Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, there requires a level of assurance in performance under many different conditions. Many times, deployed machine learning systems will require more classic logic and reasoning performed through neurosymbolic programs jointly with artificial neural network sensing. While many prior works have examined the assurance of a single component of the system solely with either the neural network alone or entire enterprise systems, very few works have examined the assurance of integrated neurosymbolic systems. Within this work, we assess the assurance of end-to-end fully differentiable neurosymbolic systems that are an emerging method to create data-efficient and more interpretable models. We perform this investigation using Scallop, an end-to-end neurosymbolic library, across classification and reasoning tasks in both the image and audio domains. We assess assurance across adversarial robustness, calibration, user performance parity, and interpretability of solutions for catching misaligned solutions. We find end-to-end neurosymbolic methods present unique opportunities for assurance beyond their data efficiency through our empirical results but not across the board. We find that this class of neurosymbolic models has higher assurance in cases where arithmetic operations are defined and where there is high dimensionality to the input space, where fully neural counterparts struggle to learn robust reasoning operations. We identify the relationship between neurosymbolic models' interpretability to catch shortcuts that later result in increased adversarial vulnerability despite performance parity. Finally, we find that the promise of data efficiency is typically only in the case of class imbalanced reasoning problems.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation and improvement of medical large language models (LLMs) are critical for their real-world deployment, particularly in ensuring accuracy, safety, and ethical alignment. Existing frameworks inadequately dissect domain-specific error patterns or address cross-modal challenges. This study introduces a granular error taxonomy through systematic analysis of top 10 models on MedBench, categorizing incorrect responses into eight types: Omissions, Hallucination, Format Mismatch, Causal Reasoning Deficiency, Contextual Inconsistency, Unanswered, Output Error, and Deficiency in Medical Language Generation. Evaluation of 10 leading models reveals vulnerabilities: despite achieving 0.86 accuracy in medical knowledge recall, critical reasoning tasks show 96.3% omission, while safety ethics evaluations expose alarming inconsistency (robustness score: 0.79) under option shuffled. Our analysis uncovers systemic weaknesses in knowledge boundary enforcement and multi-step reasoning. To address these, we propose a tiered optimization strategy spanning four levels, from prompt engineering and knowledge-augmented retrieval to hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures and causal reasoning frameworks. This work establishes an actionable roadmap for developing clinically robust LLMs while redefining evaluation paradigms through error-driven insights, ultimately advancing the safety and trustworthiness of AI in high-stakes medical environments.",

However, this black-box approach fails to explain the learned policy in a human understandable way. To address this challenge and improve the transparency, we propose a Neural Symbolic Reinforcement Learning framework by introducing symbolic logic into DRL. This framework features a fertilization of reasoning and learning modules, enabling end-to-end learning with prior symbolic knowledge. Moreover, interpretability is achieved by extracting the logical rules learned by the reasoning module in a symbolic rule space. The experimental results show that our framework has better interpretability, along with competing performance in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "abstract": "Background: In livestock animals, which artificial insemination (AI) is widely spread, a healthy uterine environment is an important factor that should be taken into account for an adequate fertilization and establishment and development of pregnancy. The main limitation to spread the frozen semen insemination in sheep is the high costs of the laparoscopy AI and the difficulty of traversing the cervix. To overcome problems associated with transcervical artificial insemination, new techniques and instruments have been proposed. The manipulation of cervix during transcervical artificial insemination in sheep can lead to a local inflammatory reaction that releases inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and cytokines, that either can negatively affect the uterine environment and consequently, the conception. In this regard, the injection of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) at the moment of AI could reduce the secretion of inflammatory mediators, promoting a healthier uterine environment favorable to conception. The flunixin meglumine is a NSAI which reduces the synthesis of PGF(2)alpha by the inibition of the cyclooxigenase. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of flunixin meglumine (non-steroid anti-inflammatory) injection on pregnancy rate of ewes inseminated by the transcervical technique. Materials, Methods & Results: In this experiment 69 pluriparous ewes were used, 29 in control group (CG) and 40 in flunixin meglumine group (FMG). The estrus detection was performed twice daily for 5 days. The ewes detected with paint in the low back were considered in estrus. The AI procedure was performed 8 h after the estrus detection. At the AI time, the ewes were separated according to body condition score in two experimental groups. The ewes of the FM Group were injected with 1.1 mg/Kg of flunixin meglumine, im, 1 h before the AI procedure. In order to locate the ostium, a vaginal speculum and a source of external light were used; whereas the fixation and traction of the ostium were performed with an Allis clamp, allowing the penetration of the semen applicator throw the vagina and cervix. The insemination procedure was performed 8h after estrous detection. There was no difference (P > 0.05) on the pregnancy rate between groups, whereas the Control group had 68.9% and the FM group had 60.0% of pregnancy. Discussion: The result demonstrates that the local inflammatory reaction caused by the traction of cervix was not detrimental to uterine environment and fertilization, since a high pregnancy rate was detected in both groups. Although the hypothesis of this study was not supported by the results, the high pregnancy rate detected in this experiment was higher than the results normally detected. Several studies have shown low pregnancy rates when transcervical artificial insemination with frozen semen is used associated to protocols of estrous synchronization. The flunixin meglumine did not improve the pregnancy rate, probably due to the insemination procedure adopted, since the traction of the cervix were performed gently, and consequently minimized the tissue damage. Thus, the inflammatory reaction may not have been sufficiently extensive as to lead to alteration of the uterine environment. These results suggested that flunixin meglumine injection did not influence the conception when was used prior to the transcervical insemination.",

Given the gate level description of a circuit, they build the corresponding Hopfield neural network, store it, calculate the energy dissipated by the network and, finally, derive the power dissipated by the original circuit. All the operations above are executed in the symbolic domain, that is, algebraic decision diagrams are used to represent and manipulate the graph specification of the neural network modelling the circuit. The approach is viable and computationally efficient. In addition, it produces power estimates which are, on average, as accurate as the ones computed by state-of-the-art power analysis tools.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Different side effects of drugs have been described in the oral cavity, including oral ulcerations. Direct contact between drugs and oral mucose may induce chemical hum or local hypersensitivity. Less frequently, these drug-induced oral ulcerations are part of a complex reaction with cutaneous or systemic manifestations. Sometimes, one or more oral ulcerations appear as the main side-effect of a drug, or exceptionally as solitary lesions. Solitary oral ulcerations usually appear after few weeks of treatment. In most of eases, these lesions resist to conventional treatments, with a rapid healing following the suppression of the responsible drug. This diagnosis is usually difficult, particularly with patients receiving multiple drug therapy. Besides, special attention must be paid to new drugs. Oral ulcerations following symptoms of burning mouth, metallic taste, dysgueusia or agueusia are strongly suggestive of a pharmacological origin. Most of the molecules able to induct solitary oral ulcerations are commonly prescribed in a) rheumatology: NSAI (diclofenac, flurbiprofen, indometacin, naproxen), long-term rheumatoid arthritis therapy (azathioprine, methotrexate, penicillamine, gold compounds, tiopronin); b) cardiology: angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (captopril, enalapril), angiotensin 2-receptor antagonist (losartan), anti-angorous (nicorandil), c) psychiatry: antidepressants (fluoxetine, lithium), d) AIDS therapy (foscarnet, zalcitabine).",

    "year": "2021",
    "author": "Mainicheva, A. Y.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This study explores the ways the symbolic aspects of the consecration of altars are manifested in 17th-21st century Siberian Orthodox churches. I focus on altars of Sophia the Wisdom of the Word of God, and the Holy Great Martyr Barbara of Heliopolis. Sources include diocese registers published in the early 1900s, 17th century documents, works of Old Russian literature, church indexes, and the ``Temples of Russia '' (temples.ru) database. On the basis of a neurosymbolic approach to completely record reference data, a conclusion is made that the consecrations of altars dedicated to Sophia Wisdom were elitist, whereas altars in the name Holy Great Martyr Barbara were rare, but were reenergized in the late 20th and early 21st century, after this saint had become the patroness of Russia's strategic missile forces. Specific cults of saints have a chance to re-emerge when biographical or historical events of a local, regional, or state level come to be associated with episodes in the history of Christianity and hagiographic vitae. Everyday life is thereby linked to a religious context, and numerous repetitions account for the fact that consecrations of altars become traditional. Temples become material symbols, and memorial dates relating to saints turn into verbal symbols functioning as mental labels.",

    "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic AI attempts to integrate neural and symbolic architectures in a manner that addresses strengths and weaknesses of each, in a complementary fashion, in order to support robust strong AI capable of reasoning, learning, and cognitive modeling. In this paper we consider the intensional First Order Logic (IFOL) as a symbolic architecture of modern robots, able to use natural languages to communicate with humans and to reason about their own knowledge with self-reference and abstraction language property. We intend to obtain the grounding of robot's language by experience of how it uses its neuronal architectures and hence by associating this experience with the mining (sense) of non-defined language concepts (particulars/individuals and universals) in PRP (Properties/Relations/Propositions) theory of IFOL.We consider the robot's four-levels knowledge structure: The syntax level of particular natural language (Italian, French, etc..), two universal language levels: its semantic logic structure (based on virtual predicates of FOL and logic connectives), and its corresponding conceptual PRP structure level which universally represents the composite mining of FOL formulae grounded on the last robot's neuro-system level. Finally, we provide the general method how to implement in IFOL (by using the abstracted terms) different kinds of modal logic operators and their deductive axioms: we present a particular example of robots autoepistemic deduction capabilities by introduction of the special temporal \\({K}{o}{n}ow\\) predicate and deductive axioms for it: reflexive, positive introspection and distributive axiom.",

    "abstract": "We introduce Physics Informed Symbolic Networks (PISN) which utilize physics-informed loss to obtain a symbolic solution for a system of Partial Differential Equations (PDE). Given a context-free grammar to describe the language of symbolic expressions, we propose to use weighted sum as continuous approximation for selection of a production rule. We use this approximation to define multilayer symbolic networks. We consider Kovasznay flow (Navier-Stokes) and two-dimensional viscous Burger's equations to illustrate that PISN are able to provide a performance comparable to PINNs across various start-of-the-art advances: multiple outputs and governing equations, domain-decomposition, hypernetworks. Furthermore, we propose Physics-informed Neurosymbolic Networks (PINSN) which employ a multilayer perceptron (MLP) operator to model the residue of symbolic networks. PINSNs are observed to give 2-3 orders of performance gain over standard PINN.",

    "abstract": "Circulating IL-6, an activator of JAK/STAT signaling, is associated with poor prognosis and aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance in hormone-receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer. Here we report the results of a phase 2 single-arm Simon 2-stage trial combining Ruxolitinib, an oral selective inhibitor of JAK1/2, with exemestane, a steroidal AI, in patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) after progression on non-steroidal AI (NSAI). Safety and efficacy were primary objectives, and analysis of inflammatory markers as predictors of response was a key secondary objective. Twenty-five subjects enrolled. The combination of ruxolitinib and exemestane was safe, though anemia requiring transfusion in 5/15 (33%) at the 25 mg dose in stage 1 led to a reduction to 15 mg twice daily in stage 2 (with no additional transfusions). Clinical benefit rate (CBR) in the overall study population was 24% (95% CI 9.4-45.1); 6/25 patients demonstrated stable disease for ≥6 months. Median progression-free survival was 2.8 months (95% CI 2.6-3.9). Exploratory biomarkers revealed high levels of systemic inflammation and 60% harbored a high-risk IL-6 genotype. Pharmacodynamics demonstrated modest on-target inhibition of phosphorylated-STAT3 by ruxolitinib at a tolerable dose. Thus, ruxolitinib combined with exemestane at a tolerable dose was safe but minimally active in AI-resistant tumors of patients with high levels of systemic inflammation. These findings highlight the need for more potent and specific therapies targeting inflammation in MBC.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the question of what types of computation and cognition large language models (LLMs) are capable of has received increasing attention. With models clearly capable of convincingly faking true reasoning behavior, the question of whether they are also capable of real reasoning-and how the difference should be defined-becomes increasingly vexed. Here we introduce a new tool, Logic Tensor Probes (LTP), that may help to shed light on the problem. Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) serve as a neural symbolic framework designed for differentiable fuzzy logics. Using a pretrained LLM with frozen weights, an LTP uses the LTN framework as a diagnostic tool. This allows for the detection and localization of logical deductions within LLMs, enabling the use of first-order logic as a versatile modeling language for investigating the internal mechanisms of LLMs. The LTP can make deductions from basic assertions, and track if the model makes the same deductions from the natural language equivalent, and if so, where in the model this happens. We validate our approach through proof-of-concept experiments on hand-crafted knowledge bases derived from WordNet and on smaller samples from FrameNet.",

    "abstract": "Legal services rely heavily on text processing. While large language models (LLMs) show promise, their application in legal contexts demands higher accuracy, repeatability, and transparency. Logic programs, by encoding legal concepts as structured rules and facts, offer reliable automation, but require sophisticated text extraction. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that integrates LLMs' natural language understanding with logic-based reasoning to address these limitations. As a legal document case study, we applied neuro-symbolic AI to coverage-related queries in insurance contracts using both closed and open-source LLMs. While LLMs have improved in legal reasoning, they still lack the accuracy and consistency required for complex contract analysis. In our analysis, we tested three methodologies to evaluate whether a specific claim is covered under a contract: a vanilla LLM, an unguided approach that leverages LLMs to encode both the contract and the claim, and a guided approach that uses a framework for the LLM to encode the contract. We demonstrated the promising capabilities of LLM + Logic in the guided approach.",

    "abstract": "Computational learning theory states that many classes of boolean formulas are learnable in polynomial time. This paper addresses the understudied subject of how, in practice, such formulas can be learned by deep neural networks. Specifically, we analyze boolean formulas associated with model-sampling benchmarks, combinatorial optimization problems, and random 3-CNFs with varying degrees of constrainedness. Our experiments indicate that: (i) neural learning generalizes better than pure rule-based systems and pure symbolic approach; (ii) relatively small and shallow neural networks are very good approximators of formulas associated with combinatorial optimization problems; (iii) smaller formulas seem harder to learn, possibly due to the fewer positive (satisfying) examples available; and (iv) interestingly, underconstrained 3-CNF formulas are more challenging to learn than overconstrained ones. Such findings pave the way for a better understanding, construction, and use of interpretable neurosymbolic AI methods.",

This paper aims to provide a timely survey of the current research with an in-depth analysis, positioning LLMs as tools for extracting and refining planning models to support reliable AP planners.

Neural-symbolic representations have emerged as a way to combine the reasoning capabilities of symbolic methods, with the expressiveness of neural networks. However, most of the existing frameworks for combining neural and symbolic representations have been designed for classic relational learning tasks that work over a universe of symbolic entities and relations. In this paper, we present DRaiL, an open-source declarative framework for specifying deep relational models, designed to support a variety of NLP scenarios. Our framework supports easy integration with expressive language encoders, and provides an interface to study the interactions between representation, inference and learning.",

    "abstract": "In this position paper, we discuss the reasons for the lack of success of rule learning, as witnessed by the quasi-absence of commercial applications, and what can be done to revive the domain and possibly to kick-start the kind of explosive development that statistical Machine Learning and Neural Networks have experienced over the past 15 years. The root cause of the problem is well-known, and it is not the rule learning algorithms themselves: if the representation language to which a rule learning algorithm has access - often only the representation model of the input data - is not appropriate to represent the decision rules, the algorithm has no way to generate a decision ruleset that generalizes well. Feature generation and other methods that have been proposed to augment the data representation language are useful, but we argue that the focus should be on discovering the conceptual model that underly the decision. We claim that this amounts to discovering the structure of decisions, that is, to learn decision models. We outline some potentially fruitful research directions, and how this topic is central to neuro-symbolic learning.",

Specifically, the commonsense scene composition capability refers to the understanding of the spatial relationships among related objects in the scene, which in this article is modeled as a joint probability distribution for all possible locations of the semantic object class. The proposed framework includes two variants of a Correlation Information (CECI) model for learning probability distributions: (i) a baseline approach based on a Graph Convolutional Network, and (ii) a neuro-symbolic extension that integrates a spatial ontology based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, this article provides a detailed description of the dataset generation process for such tasks. Finally, the framework has been validated through multiple runs on simulated data, as well as in a real-world indoor environment, demonstrating its ability to spatially interpret scenes across different room types.",

Blocksworld is one of the oldest high-level task planning domain that is well defined but contains sufficient complexity, e.g., the conflicting subgoals and the decomposability into subproblems. We aim to make this dataset a benchmark for Neural-Symbolic integrated systems and accelerate the research in this area. The key advantage of such systems is the ability to obtain a symbolic model from the real-world input and perform a fast, systematic, complete algorithm for symbolic reasoning, without any supervision and the reward signal from the environment.",

    "abstract": "Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI studies the integration of neural networks (NNs) and symbolic reasoning based on logic. Usually, NeSy techniques focus on learning the neural, probabilistic and/or fuzzy parameters of NeSy models. Learning the symbolic or logical structure of such models has, so far, received less attention. We introduce neurosymbolic decision trees (NDTs), as an extension of decision trees together with a novel NeSy structure learning algorithm, which we dub NeuID3. NeuID3 adapts the standard top-down induction of decision tree algorithms and combines it with a neural probabilistic logic representation, inherited from the DeepProbLog family of models. The key advantage of learning NDTs with NeuID3 is the support of both symbolic and subsymbolic data (such as images), and that they can exploit background knowledge during the induction of the tree structure, In our experimental evaluation we demonstrate the benefits of NeSys structure learning over more traditonal approaches such as purely data-driven learning with neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Human reasoning can often be understood as an interplay between two systems: the intuitive and associative ( System 1 ) and the deliberative and logical ( System 2 ). Neural sequence models - which have been increasingly successful at performing complex, structured tasks - exhibit the advantages and failure modes of System 1: they are fast and learn patterns from data, but are often inconsistent and incoherent. In this work, we seek a lightweight, training-free means of improving existing System 1-like sequence models by adding System 2-inspired logical reasoning. We explore several variations on this theme in which candidate generations from a neural sequence model are examined for logical consistency by a symbolic reasoning module, which can either accept or reject the generations. Our approach uses neural inference to mediate between the neural System 1 and the logical System 2. Results in robust story generation and grounded instruction-following show that this approach can increase the coherence and accuracy of neurally-based generations.",

    "abstract": "Synthesizing programs from examples requires searching over a vast, combinatorial space of possible programs. In this search process, a key challenge is representing the behavior of a partially written program before it can be executed, to judge if it is on the right track and predict where to search next. We introduce a general technique for representing partially written programs in a program synthesis engine. We take inspiration from the technique of abstract interpretation, in which an approximate execution model is used to determine if an unfinished program will eventually satisfy a goal specification. Here we learn an approximate execution model implemented as a modular neural network. By constructing compositional program representations that implicitly encode the interpretation semantics of the underlying programming language, we can represent partial programs using a flexible combination of concrete execution state and learned neural representations, using the learned approximate semantics when concrete semantics are not known (in unfinished parts of the program). We show that these hybrid neuro-symbolic representations enable execution-guided synthesizers to use more powerful language constructs, such as loops and higher-order functions, and can be used to synthesize programs more accurately for a given search budget than pure neural approaches in several domains.",

We introduce a method for generating symbolic expressions to solve differential equations while leveraging deep learning training methods. Unlike existing methods, our system does not require learning a language model over symbolic mathematics, making it scalable, compact, and easily adaptable for a variety of tasks and configurations. As part of the method, we propose a novel neural architecture for learning mathematical expressions to optimize a customizable objective. The system is designed to always return a valid symbolic formula, generating a useful approximation when an exact analytic solution to a differential equation is not or cannot be found. We demonstrate through examples how our method can be applied on a number of differential equations, often obtaining symbolic approximations that are useful or insightful. Furthermore, we show how the system can be effortlessly generalized to find symbolic solutions to other mathematical tasks, including integration and functional equations.",

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) twin systems will be a fundamental enabler of zero-touch network and service management (ZSM) for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. A reliable XAI twin system for ZSM requires two composites: an extreme analytical ability for discretizing the physical behavior of the Internet of Everything (IoE) and rigorous methods for characterizing the reasoning of such behavior. In this paper, a novel neuro-symbolic explainable artificial intelligence twin framework is proposed to enable trustworthy ZSM for a wireless IoE. The physical space of the XAI twin executes a neural-network-driven multivariate regression to capture the time-dependent wireless IoE environment while determining unconscious decisions of IoE service aggregation. Subsequently, the virtual space of the XAI twin constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based Bayesian network that can infer a symbolic reasoning score over unconscious decisions through a first-order probabilistic language model. Furthermore, a Bayesian multi-arm bandits-based learning problem is proposed for reducing the gap between the expected explained score and the current obtained score of the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin. To address the challenges of extensible, modular, and stateless management functions in ZSM, the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin framework consists of two learning systems: 1) an implicit learner that acts as an unconscious learner in physical space, and 2) an explicit leaner that can exploit symbolic reasoning based on implicit learner decisions and prior evidence. Experimental results show that the proposed neuro-symbolic XAI twin can achieve around 96.26% accuracy while guaranteeing from 18% to 44% more trust score in terms of reasoning and closed-loop automation.",

    "abstract": "The unification of statistical (data-driven) and symbolic (knowledge-driven) methods is widely recognised as one of the key challenges of modern AI. Recent years have seen large number of publications on such hybrid neuro-symbolic AI systems. That rapidly growing literature is highly diverse and mostly empirical, and is lacking a unifying view of the large variety of these hybrid systems. In this paper we analyse a large body of recent literature and we propose a set of modular design patterns for such hybrid, neuro-symbolic systems. We are able to describe the architecture of a very large number of hybrid systems by composing only a small set of elementary patterns as building blocks. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a taxonomically organised vocabulary to describe both processes and data structures used in hybrid systems; 2) a set of 15+ design patterns for hybrid AI systems, organised in a set of elementary patterns and a set of compositional patterns; 3) an application of these design patterns in two realistic use-cases for hybrid AI systems. Our patterns reveal similarities between systems that were not recognised until now. Finally, our design patterns extend and refine Kautz' earlier attempt at categorising neuro-symbolic architectures.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The prediction made by a learned model is rarely the end outcome of interest to a given agent. In most real-life scenarios, a certain policy is applied on the model's prediction and on some relevant context to reach a decision. It is the (possibly temporally distant) effects of this decision that bring value to the agent. Moreover, it is those effects, and not the model's prediction, that need to be evaluated as far as the agent's satisfaction is concerned. The formalization of such scenarios naturally raises certain questions: How should a learned model be integrated with a policy to reach decisions? How should the learned model be trained and evaluated in the presence of such a policy? How is the training affected in terms of the type of access that one has on the policy? How can the policy be represented and updated in a way that is cognitively compatible with a human, so that it offers an explainable layer of reasoning on top of the learned model? This chapter offers a high-level overview of past work on the integration of modular reasoning with autodidactic learning and with user-driven coaching, as it applies on neural-symbolic architectures that combine sequentially a neural module with an arbitrary symbolically represented (and possibly non-differentiable) policy. In this context, the chapter offers responses to the questions above when the policy can be reasoned with only in a deductive manner, or in a deductive and an abductive manner. It further discusses how the policy can be learned / updated in an elaboration-tolerant and cognitivelylight manner through machine coaching, and highlights the connections of the dialectical coaching process with the central role that argumentation plays in human reasoning.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has been at the core of the autonomous driving field development, due to the neural networks' success in finding patterns in raw data and turning them into accurate predictions. Moreover, recent neuro-symbolic works have shown that incorporating the available background knowledge about the problem at hand in the loss function via t-norms can further improve the deep learning models' performance. However, t-norm-based losses may have very high memory requirements and, thus, they may be impossible to apply in complex application domains like autonomous driving. In this paper, we show how it is possible to define memory-efficient t-norm-based losses, allowing for exploiting t-norms for the task of event detection in autonomous driving. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis on the ROAD-R dataset and show (i) that our proposal can be implemented and run on GPUs with less than 25 GiB of available memory, while standard t-norm-based losses are estimated to require more than 100 GiB, far exceeding the amount of memory normally available, (ii) that t-norm-based losses improve performance, especially when limited labelled data are available, and (iii) that t-norm-based losses can further improve performance when exploited on both labelled and unlabelled data.",

    "abstract": "The recent advances in large language models (LLM) and foundation models with emergent capabilities have been shown to improve the performance of many NLP tasks. LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KG) can complement each other such that LLMs can be used for KG construction or completion while existing KGs can be used for different tasks such as making LLM outputs explainable or fact-checking in Neuro-Symbolic manner. In this paper, we present Text2KGBench, a benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of language models to generate KGs from natural language text guided by an ontology. Given an input ontology and a set of sentences, the task is to extract facts from the text while complying with the given ontology (concepts, relations, domain/range constraints) and being faithful to the input sentences. We provide two datasets (i) Wikidata-TekGen with 10 ontologies and 13,474 sentences and (ii) DBpedia-WebNLG with 19 ontologies and 4,860 sentences. We define seven evaluation metrics to measure fact extraction performance, ontology conformance, and hallucinations by LLMs. Furthermore, we provide results for two baseline models, Vicuna-13B and Alpaca-LoRA-13B using automatic prompt generation from test cases. The baseline results show that there is room for improvement using both Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing techniques.

    "abstract": "Neural network-based policies have demonstrated success in many robotic applications, but often lack human-explanability, which poses challenges in safety-critical deployments. To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics - conciseness, consistency, and strictness - to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Geometry problem solving (GPS) requires capacities of multi-modal understanding, multi-hop reasoning and theorem knowledge application. In this paper, we propose a neural-symbolic model for plane geometry problem solving (PGPS), named PGPSNet-v2, with three key steps: modal fusion, reasoning process and knowledge verification. In modal fusion, we leverage textual clauses to express fine-grained structural and semantic content of geometry diagram, and fuse diagram with textual problem efficiently through structural-semantic pre-training. For reasoning, we design an explicable solution program to describe the geometric reasoning process, and employ a self-limited decoder to generate solution program autoregressively. To reduce solution errors, a multi-level theorem verifier is proposed to eliminate solutions that do not match geometric principles, alleviating the hallucination of the neural model. We also construct a large-scale geometry problem dataset called PGPS9K, containing fine-grained annotations of textual clauses, solution program and involved knowledge tuples. Extensive experiments on datasets Geometry3K and PGPS9K show that our PGPSNet solver outperforms existing symbolic and neural solvers in GPS performance, while maintaining good explainability and reliability, and the solver components (fusion, reasoning, verification) are all justified effective.",

    "abstract": "The observation that computer vision methods overfit to dataset specifics has inspired diverse attempts to make object recognition models robust to domain shifts. However, similar work on domain-robust visual question answering methods is very limited. Domain adaptation for VQA differs from adaptation for object recognition due to additional complexity: VQA models handle multimodal inputs, methods contain multiple steps with diverse modules resulting in complex optimization, and answer spaces in different datasets are vastly different. To tackle these challenges, we first quantify domain shifts between popular VQA datasets, in both visual and textual space. To disentangle shifts between datasets arising from different modalities, we also construct synthetic shifts in the image and question domains separately. Second, we test the robustness of different families of VQA methods (classic two-stream, transformer, and neuro-symbolic methods) to these shifts. Third, we test the applicability of existing domain adaptation methods and devise a new one to bridge VQA domain gaps, adjusted to specific VQA models. To emulate the setting of real-world generalization, we focus on unsupervised domain adaptation and the open-ended classification task formulation.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The time when the connectionist and symbolic perspectives of Artificial Intelligence (AI) competed against each other is now over. The rivalry was due essentially to ignorance on the implications of the knowledge level, as introduced by Newell and Mart. Now it is generally accepted that they are different and complementary forms of modeling and operationalizing the inferences in terms of which a problem solving method (PSM) decomposes a task. All these tasks, methods, inferences, and formal operators belong to a broad library of reusable components for knowledge modeling. The final configuration of a problem solving method, with symbolic and connectionist components, is only dependent on the particular balance between data and knowledge available for the specific application under consideration. Various approaches have been explored for neurosymbolic integration. In this paper we propose a classification of these approaches (unified, hybrid and system level) and strongly support that the integration has to be made at the knowledge level and in the domain of the external observer (the ``house '' of models).",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of preference learning, which aims to learn user-specific preferences (e.g., \"good parking spot\", \"convenient drop-off location\") from visual input. Despite its similarity to learning factual concepts (e.g., \"red cube\"), preference learning is a fundamentally harder problem due to its subjective nature and the paucity of person-specific training data. We address this problem using a new framework called Synapse, which is a neuro-symbolic approach designed to efficiently learn preferential concepts from limited demonstrations. Synapse represents preferences as neuro-symbolic programs in a domain-specific language (DSL) that operates over images, and leverages a novel combination of visual parsing, large language models, and program synthesis to learn programs representing individual preferences. We evaluate Synapse through extensive experimentation including a user case study focusing on mobility-related concepts in mobile robotics and autonomous driving. Our evaluation demonstrates that Synapse significantly outperforms existing baselines as well as its own ablations.

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Neutropenia and diarrhoea are common and potentially serious adverse events associated with abemaciclib in advanced breast cancer (ABC), and the risk factors have been minimally explored. The study aimed to develop clinical prediction tools that allow personalized predictions of neutropenia and diarrhoea following abemaciclib initiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data was pooled from MONARCH 1, 2 and 3 trials investigating abemaciclib. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to assess the association between pre-treatment clinicopathological data and grade ≥3 diarrhoea and neutropenia occurring within the first 365 days of abemaciclib use. RESULTS: Older age was associated with increased risk of grade ≥3 diarrhoea [HR [95%CI] for age > 70: 1.72 [1.14-2.58]; P = 0.009]. A clinical prediction tool for abemaciclib induced grade ≥3 neutropenia was optimally defined by race, ECOGPS and white blood cell count. Large discrimination between subgroups was observed; the highest risk subgroup had a 64% probability of grade ≥3 neutropenia within the first 365 days of abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily) + fulvestrant/NSAI, compared to 5% for the lowest risk subgroup. CONCLUSION: The study identified advanced age as significantly associated with an increased risk of abemaciclib induced grade ≥ 3 diarrhoea. A clinical prediction tool, defined by race, ECOGPS and pre-treatment white blood cell count, was able to discriminate subgroups with significantly different risks of grade ≥3 neutropenia following abemaciclib initiation. The tool may enable improved interpretation of personalized risks and the risk-benefit ratio of abemaciclib.",

The case was a 96-year-old man with painful and restricted movement of the right shoulder joint. A record was made of parameters before the start of treatment using the Oxford Shoulder Score [1] and repeated following 12 treatment sessions in a four-week period.

    "abstract": "Link prediction is an important task in addressing the incompleteness problem of knowledge graphs (KG). Previous link prediction models suffer from issues related to either performance or explanatory capability. Furthermore, models that are capable of generating explanations, often struggle with erroneous paths or reasoning leading to the correct answer. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Neural-Symbolic model named FaSt-FLiP (stands for Fast and Slow Thinking with Filtered rules for Link Prediction task), inspired by two distinct aspects of human cognition: commonsense reasoning and thinking, fast and slow. Our objective is to combine a logical and neural model for enhanced link prediction. To tackle the challenge of dealing with incorrect paths or rules generated by the logical model, we propose a semi-supervised method to convert rules into sentences. These sentences are then subjected to assessment and removal of incorrect rules using an NLI (Natural Language Inference) model. Our approach to combining logical and neural models involves first obtaining answers from both the logical and neural models. These answers are subsequently unified using an Inference Engine module, which has been realized through both algorithmic implementation and a novel neural model architecture. To validate the efficacy of our model, we conducted a series of experiments. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our model in both link prediction metrics and the generation of more reliable explanations.",

    "author": "Thayaparan, Mokanarangan and Valentino, Marco and André, Freitas",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Integer Linear Programming (ILP) provides a viable mechanism to encode explicit and controllable assumptions about explainable multi-hop inference with natural language. However, an ILP formulation is non-differentiable and cannot be integrated into broader deep learning architectures. Recently, Thayaparan et al. (2021a) proposed a novel methodology to integrate ILP with Transformers to achieve end-to-end differentiability for complex multi-hop inference. While this hybrid framework has been demonstrated to deliver better answer and explanation selection than transformer-based and existing ILP solvers, the neuro-symbolic integration still relies on a convex relaxation of the ILP formulation, which can produce sub-optimal solutions. To improve these limitations, we propose Diff-Comb Explainer, a novel neuro-symbolic architecture based on Differentiable BlackBox Combinatorial solvers (DBCS) (Poganč ić et al., 2019). Unlike existing differentiable solvers, the presented model does not require the transformation and relaxation of the explicit semantic constraints, allowing for direct and more efficient integration of ILP formulations. Diff-Comb Explainer demonstrates improved accuracy and explainability over non-differentiable solvers, Transformers and existing differentiable constraint-based multi-hop inference frameworks.",

    "author": "Molokopoy, V. and D'Angiulli, A.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This article will explore the expressivity and tractability of vividness, as viewed from the interdisciplinary perspective of the cognitive sciences, including the sub-disciplines of artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and phenomenology. Following the precursor work by Benussi in experimental phenomenology, seminal papers by David Marks in psychology and, later, Hector Levesque in computer science, a substantial part of the discussion has been around a symbolic approach to the concept of vividness. At the same time, a similar concept linked to semantic memory, imagery, and mental models has had a long history in cognitive psychology, with new emerging links to cognitive neuroscience. More recently, there is a push towards neural-symbolic representations which allows room for the integration of brain models of vividness to a symbolic concept of vividness. Such works lead to question the phenomenology of vividness in the context of consciousness, and the related ethical concerns. The purpose of this paper is to review the state of the art, advances, and further potential developments of artificial-human vividness while laying the ground for a shared conceptual platform for dialogue, communication, and debate across all the relevant sub-disciplines. Within such context, an important goal of the paper is to define the crucial role of vividness in grounding simulation and modeling within the psychology (and neuroscience) of human reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has not achieved defining features of biological intelligence despite models boasting more parameters than neurons in the human brain. In this perspective article, we synthesize historical approaches to understanding intelligent systems and argue that methodological and epistemic biases in these fields can be resolved by shifting away from cognitivist brain-as-computer theories and recognizing that brains exist within large, interdependent living systems. Integrating the dynamical systems view of cognition with the massive distributed feedback of perceptual control theory highlights a theoretical gap in our understanding of nonreductive neural mechanisms. Cell assemblies-properly conceived as reentrant dynamical flows and not merely as identified groups of neurons-may fill that gap by providing a minimal supraneuronal level of organization that establishes a neurodynamical base layer for computation. By considering information streams from physical embodiment and situational embedding, we discuss this computational base layer in terms of conserved oscillatory and structural properties of cortical-hippocampal networks. Our synthesis of embodied cognition, based in dynamical systems and perceptual control, aims to bypass the neurosymbolic stalemates that have arisen in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, and computational neuroscience.",

The conjugate was evaluated in a novel cellulose acetate (CA) membrane-based immunoassay which utilizes the especially strong physical attachment of the polymer to CA to bind and concentrate the polymer attached protein onto the membrane. When compared in the CA membrane immunoassay to the anti-body-poly(NIPAAm) conjugate prepared via anhydrous copolymerization of NIPAAm and NASI at the monomer feed ratio of 40:1, respectively, the performance of the NIPAAm/nBAAm/NASI terpolymer was superior to that of the NIPAAm/NASI copolymer (LCST = 32 degrees C) when the studies were carried out at room temperature. However, the terpolymer and copolymer gave equivalent performance when the assay mixture was heated to 45 degrees C. These results indicate the importance of the LCST of the polymer component of the Ab-polymer conjugate to its adsorption and binding on the CA membrane.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Traditional computer vision approaches, based on neural networks (NN), are typically trained on a large amount of image data. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss between a prediction and a given class label, the NN and its visual embedding space are learned to fulfill a given task. However, due to the sole dependence on the image data distribution of the training domain, these models tend to fail when applied to a target domain that differs from their source domain. To learn a more robust NN to domain shifts, we propose the knowledge graph neural network (KG-NN), a neuro-symbolic approach that supervises the training using image-data-invariant auxiliary knowledge. The auxiliary knowledge is first encoded in a knowledge graph with respective concepts and their relationships, which is then transformed into a dense vector representation via an embedding method. Using a contrastive loss function, KG-NN learns to adapt its visual embedding space and thus its weights according to the image-data invariant knowledge graph embedding space. We evaluate KG-NN on visual transfer learning tasks for classification using the mini-ImageNet dataset and its derivatives, as well as road sign recognition datasets from Germany and China. The results show that a visual model trained with a knowledge graph as a trainer outperforms a model trained with cross-entropy in all experiments, in particular when the domain gap increases. Besides better performance and stronger robustness to domain shifts, these KG-NN adapts to multiple datasets and classes without suffering heavily from catastrophic forgetting.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "As the roles of robots continue to expand in general, there is an increasing demand for research on automated task planning for a multi-agent system that can independently execute tasks in a wide and dynamic environment. This study introduces a plugin framework in which multiple robots can be involved in task planning in a broad range of areas by combining symbolic and connectionist approaches. The symbolic approach for understanding and learning human knowledge is useful for task planning in a wide and static environment. The network-based connectionist approach has the advantage of being able to respond to an ever-changing dynamic environment. A planning domain definition language-based planning algorithm, which is a symbolic approach, and the cooperative-competitive reinforcement learning algorithm, which is a connectionist approach, were utilized in this study. The proposed architecture is verified through a simulation. It is also verified through an experiment using 10 unmanned surface vehicles that the given tasks were successfully executed in a wide and dynamic environment.",

It may be due to expected, dose dependant properties of the drug, to immuno-allergic or bio-genomic mechanisms. Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been described resulting in osmotic, secretory or inflammatory diarrhea, shortened transit time, or malabsorption. Histopathological lesions sometimes associated with drug induced diarrhea are usually non specific and include ulcerations, inflammatory or ischemic lesions, fibrous diaphragms, microscopic colitis and apoptosis. The diagnosis of drug induced diarrhea, sometimes difficult to assess, relies on the absence of other obvious causes and on the rapid disappearance of the symptoms after withdrawal of the suspected drug.",

    "abstract": "While supervised learning has achieved significant success in computer vision tasks, acquiring high-quality annotated data remains a bottleneck. This paper explores both scholarly and non-scholarly works in AI-assistive deep learning image annotation systems that provide textual suggestions, captions, or descriptions of the input image to the annotator. This potentially results in higher annotation efficiency and quality. Our exploration covers annotation for a range of computer vision tasks including image classification, object detection, regression, instance, semantic segmentation, and pose estimation. We review various datasets and how they contribute to the training and evaluation of AI-assistive annotation systems. We also examine methods leveraging neuro-symbolic learning, deep active learning, and self-supervised learning algorithms that enable semantic image understanding and generate free-text output. These include image captioning, visual question answering, and multi-modal reasoning. Despite the promising potential, there is limited publicly available work on AI-assistive image annotation with textual output capabilities. We conclude by suggesting future research directions to advance this field, emphasizing the need for more publicly accessible datasets and collaborative efforts between academia and industry.",

To manage the amount of data several strategies have been followed and a lot of achievements were made especially in artificial intelligence. But still the capabilities of human intelligence are unrivaled. The contribution of this article is an introduction to a decision unit based on psychoanalytical models and a description how the findings can be used in future robotic applications. The neuro-psychoanalytical theories used, cover a comprehensive model of human intelligence and presents structures for all aspects of human decision making. The psychoanalytic-inspired decision unit shows promising prospects that standard planning and control units lack in various respects. Amongst others, scenario and experience-based planning, drive-based intention models, and the 3-tier (neuro-symbolic, thing presentations, word presentations) data processing architecture, are very promising methods. In order to validate the model, a simulation environment was implemented holding various agents with the neuro-psychoanalytical decision unit. This first implementation shows the possibilities of the system and gives a great outlook for future investigations of the capabilities.",

The downside of this approach is that they do not provide understandable explanations on how the sentiment values are calculated.

Therefore, it is natural to wonder if the two approaches can be combined to exploit their advantages. In this chapter, we present a neuro-symbolic approach that combines both symbolic and deep learning approaches for sentiment analysis tasks. The symbolic approach exploits sentiment lexicon and shifter patterns-which cover the operations of inversion/reversal, intensification, and attenuation/downtoning. The deep learning approach used a pre-trained language model (PLM) to construct sentiment lexicon. Our experimental result shows that the proposed approach leads to promising results, substantially better than the results of a pure lexicon-based approach. Although the results did not reach the level of the deep learning approach, a great advantage is that sentiment prediction can be accompanied by understandable explanations. For some users, it is very important to see how sentiment is derived, even if performance is a little lower.",

    "abstract": "According to how AI has defined itself from its beginning, thinking in non-living matter, i.e., without life, is possible. The premise of symbolic AI is that operating on representations of reality machines can understand it. When this assumption did not work as expected, the mathematical model of the neuron became the engine of artificial ``brains. '' Connectionism followed. Currently, in the context of Machine Learning success, attempts are made at integrating the symbolic and connectionist paths. There is hope that Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) performance can be achieved. As encouraging as neuro-symbolic AI seems to be, it remains unclear whether AGI is actually a moving target as long as AI itself remains ambiguously defined. This paper makes the argument that the intelligence of machines, expressed in their performance, reflects how adequate the means used for achieving it are. Therefore, energy use and the amount of data necessary qualify as a good metric for comparing natural and artificial performance.",

    "abstract": "Desmoid tumors (DTs) are rare, aggressive malignancies developing from clonal fibroblastic proliferation originating from soft tissues. Despite their low metastatic potential, their invasiveness towards neighboring organs and a high recurrence rate contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality, thereby impacting the quality of life of patients. Several therapeutic options are available, but standardized protocols are lacking. In this study, we reviewed 14 cases of DT retrospectively over a period of 15 years, from September 2008 to December 2023. The most prevalent tumor locations were in the extremities, and the majority of patients were female. We identified risk factors in two patients, those being surgical trauma and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Half of the patients underwent surgery for DT, and two received salvage radiotherapy. Systemic therapy was used in the first and second lines and comprised of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAI). Active surveillance was proposed in three patients. This is the first retrospective study to assess the characteristics of DT in Moroccan patients in a tertiary care setting. It aims to shed light on the challenges faced in treating these rare tumors in the context of a lack of therapeutic standardization.",

    "abstract": "Our goal is to enable embodied agents to learn inductively generalizable spatial concepts, e.g., learning staircase as an inductive composition of towers of increasing height. Given a human demonstration, we seek a learning architecture that infers a succinct program representation that explains the observed instance. Additionally, the approach should generalize inductively to novel structures of different sizes or complex structures expressed as a hierarchical composition of previously learned concepts. Existing approaches that use code generation capabilities of pre-trained large (visual) language models, as well as purely neural models, show poor generalization to a-priori unseen complex concepts.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Deep generative models are becoming increasingly used as tools for financial analysis. However, it is unclear how these models will influence financial markets, especially when they infer financial value in a semi-autonomous way. In this work, we explore the interplay between deep generative models and market dynamics. We develop a form of virtual traders that use deep generative models to make buy/sell decisions, which we term neuro-symbolic traders, and expose them to a virtual market. Under our framework, neuro-symbolic traders are agents that use vision-language models to discover a model of the fundamental value of an asset. Agents develop this model as a stochastic differential equation, calibrated to market data using gradient descent. We test our neuro-symbolic traders on both synthetic data and real financial time series, including an equity stock, commodity, and a foreign exchange pair. We then expose several groups of neuro-symbolic traders to a virtual market environment. This market environment allows for feedback between the traders belief of the underlying value to the observed price dynamics. We find that this leads to price suppression compared to the historical data, highlighting a future risk to market stability. Our work is a first step towards quantifying the effect of deep generative agents on markets dynamics and sets out some of the potential risks and benefits of this approach in the future.",

    "year": "2023",
    "author": "Nandwani, Yatin and Mausam and Parag, Singla",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Recently there has been a lot of focus on developing deep learning models for symbolic reasoning tasks. One such task involves solving combinatorial problems, which can be viewed as instances of a constraint satisfaction problem, albeit with unknown constraints. The task of the neural model is then to discover the unknown constraints using the training data consisting of many solved instances. There are broadly two approaches for learning the unknown constraints: the first approach creates a purely neural model that maps an input puzzle directly to its solution, thereby representing the constraints implicitly in the model's weights [ 1, 2, 3], and the second approach invokes a symbolic reasoner, such as an Integer Linear Program (ILP) solver, learning the constraints explicitly in the solver's language, e.g., linear inequalities for an ILP solver [ 4, 5]. In this chapter, we discuss about both the implicit and explicit approaches. In the implicit approach, we review three neural architectures for solving combinatorial problems, viz., Neural Logic Machines (NLM) [ 2], Recurrent Relational Networks (RRN) [ 1], and its extensions proposed by Nandwani et al. [ 3] to tackle output space invariance (solving 16x16 sudoku after training on 9x9 sudokus). Under the second approach having explicit representation of constraints, we present two methods (CombOptNet [ 5] and ILP-Loss [ 4]) for end-to-end training of a Neural-ILP architecture: a neuro-symbolic model where a neural perception layer is followed by an ILP layer to represent reasoning. CombOptNet proposed by Paulus et al. [ 5] trains slowly owing to a call to an ILP solver in each learning iteration. On the other hand, ILP-Loss proposed by Nandwani et al. [ 4] is solver-free during training and thus much more scalable. In the end, we present specific experiments from [ 3] and [ 4] that compare the different methods discussed in this chapter.",

We exhibit a subset of all possible average fields. The corresponding microgeometries are laminates of infinite rank. The problem originated in the search for the effective conductivity of polycrystalline composites. In the latter context, our result is an improvement of the previously known bounds established by Nesi & Milton, hence proving the optimality of a new full-measure class of microgeometries.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we propose a unified approach for integrating implicit and explicit knowledge in neurosymbolic systems as a combination of neural and neuro-fuzzy modules. In the developed hybrid system, training data set is used for building neuro-fuzzy modules, and represents implicit domain knowledge. The explicit domain knowledge on the other hand is represented by fuzzy rules, which are directly mapped into equivalent neural structures. The aim of this approach is to improve the abilities of modular neural structures, which are based on incomplete learning data sets, since the knowledge acquired from human experts is taken into account for adapting the general neural architecture. Three methods to combine the explicit and implicit knowledge modules are proposed. The techniques used to extract fuzzy rules from neural implicit knowledge modules are described. These techniques improve the structure and the behavior of the entire system. The proposed methodology has been applied in the field of air quality prediction with very encouraging results. These experiments show that the method is worth further investigation.",

    "abstract": "This study makes significant contributions to the field by examining the transformative role of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) in advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly healthcare (SDG3), sustainable energy (SDG7), and industry and infrastructure (SDG9). Using BERTopic modeling, a machine learning technique, this research systematically analyzes literature from 2013 to 2024, providing an overview of AI and big data applications mapped to SDGs which is a first. This structured approach identifies key SDGs impacted by these technologies and highlights interdisciplinary methods that further enhance SDG outcomes. AI applications notably improve healthcare by advancing disease tracking, tailored treatments, and precision medicine, fostering universal healthcare and reducing noncommunicable disease mortality. In energy, AI-driven solutions optimize forecasting, grid management, and renewable integration, while in industry, they bolster infrastructure resilience through innovations like predictive maintenance and automated quality control within Industry 4.0 frameworks. The integration of automated text analysis and semantic context captures broad trends, contributing both methodologically and substantively at the intersection of AI and sustainability. Despite these advancements, the study underscores ethical concerns, including data privacy, security, and algorithmic biases. Interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals, engineers, environmental scientists, and AI experts is crucial to developing ethical, scalable AI solutions. The study suggests future research focus on AI transparency, scaling across diverse sectors, and integrating advanced techniques such as neurosymbolic AI and quantum neural networks to enhance system reliability. These insights offer practical implications, reinforcing the potential of AI and big data to address global challenges sustainably while calling for balanced attention to ethical and regulatory dimensions.",

A few hours after one single systemic dose, concentrations in the synovial fluid are higher than in serum. During chronic administration, concentrations of NSAI drugs with a short half-life vary less in synovial fluid than in serum.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used for complex image recognition tasks. Due to the highly entangled correlations learned by the latent features in the convolutional kernels of CNNs, deriving human-comprehensible knowledge from CNNs has been proven difficult. As such, reasoning from relationships between kernels has been limited, resulting in little knowledge transfer from one task to another related task learned by CNNs. This paper introduces a neural-symbolic approach for providing semantically meaningful explanations to CNNs using logical rules and a shared conceptual representation space to capture the meaning of the knowledge learned. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated using benchmark chest x-rays of two respiratory conditions: pleural effusion and COVID-19. Our results show empirically that symbolic rules can be associated with semantically meaningful explanations obtained from different but related CNN models, even in domains requiring specialised knowledge such as medical imaging. This work is expected to aid the analysis of black-box CNNs by associating the predictions obtained from the CNNs with clinical research findings.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved outstanding performance in radiology tasks. However, CNNs lack the transparency and explainability necessary to enable their practical clinical adoption. This paper introduces a neural-symbolic approach allowing domain experts to intervene in the training of CNNs. Following extraction and expert validation of meaningful symbolic knowledge from a trained CNN, such knowledge is distilled back into a streamlined CNN. The approach is shown to enhance user control over conventional CNN training by combining interpretable symbolic representations into a simplified CNN, allowing domain experts to control the decision making process. The kernels in a given CNN layer are mapped to symbolic knowledge representations in the form of logic programming rules. Extracted knowledge is evaluated against known radiomics features, allowing doctors to decide based on best practice which kernels to keep or reject. Expert intervention takes place through relevant knowledge distillation back into a more compact CNN. Our results show that a student CNN can learn successfully even from multiple teachers (different knowledge-bases) to replicate the selected relevant kernels and corresponding classification results. The proposed approach delivers a trainable parameter reduction of at least 56.3% while achieving high cosine similarity for kernel replication and a fidelity score of 99.2%. Expert validation highlights the importance of this approach at fostering greater trust in AI-driven medical decision making.",

    "abstract": "Weak supervision allows machine learning models to learn from limited or noisy labels, but it introduces challenges in interpretability and reliability - particularly in multi-instance partial label learning (MI-PLL), where models must resolve both ambiguous labels and uncertain instance-label mappings. We propose a semantics for neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to improve MI-PLL by providing structured relational constraints that guide learning. Within our semantic characterization, ILP defines a logical hypothesis space for label transitions, clarifies classifier semantics, and establishes interpretable performance standards. This hybrid approach improves robustness, transparency, and accountability in weakly supervised settings, ensuring neural predictions align with domain knowledge. By embedding weak supervision into a logical framework, we enhance both interpretability and learning, making weak supervision more suitable for real-world, high-stakes applications.",

    "abstract": "Head injuries can occur in most sporting activities. The seriousness of these injuries can vary greatly depending on the sport. Many sports such as American football, cricket, baseball and hurling try to reduce this risk by designing helmets that are suitable to be worn by the players. The National Standard Authority of Ireland (NSAI) has recently made great strides in this area with the introduction of the first comprehensive standard adopted for the sport I.S. 355:2006, which sets out new testing procedures that all new helmets must meet. The Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) has also stated its intention to make the wearing of sports helmets compulsory up to minor level. The hope is that in time all the players will become comfortable with wearing helmets which has been found to be a major reason for the current low wear rates. This paper covers the testing and modelling of energy absorbing materials to ascertain the optimum thickness, and density of foam within the helmet. Static tests are carried out on a compression test machine to obtain stress/strain properties. The foams are tested on a purpose built drop test rig; the displacement, impact force, velocity and acceleration are measured using LabView and a high speed camera with TEMA analysis software to gain a greater understanding of the impact mechanics of each material. The foams are modelled, both statically and dynamically, using finite element analysis. The static model uses the ANSYS implicit solver, while the dynamic model uses ANSYS/LS-DYNA to create and validate an appropriate foam material model. The displacement, velocity, and energy results from the finite element model and the test results are analysed and compared so that the optimum density and thickness of foam can be obtained.",

    "year": "2024",
    "author": "Spivack, Nova and Douglas, Sam and Crames, Michelle and Tim, Connors",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Recent studies of the applications of conversational AI tools, such as chatbots powered by large language models, to complex real-world knowledge work have shown limitations related to reasoning and multi-step problem solving. Specifically, while existing chatbots simulate shallow reasoning and understanding they are prone to errors as problem complexity increases. The failure of these systems to address complex knowledge work is due to the fact that they do not perform any actual cognition. In this position paper, we present Cognitive AI, a higher-level framework for implementing programmatically defined neuro-symbolic cognition above and outside of large language models. Specifically, we propose a dual-layer functional architecture for Cognitive AI that serves as a roadmap for AI systems that can perform complex multi-step knowledge work. We propose that Cognitive AI is a necessary precursor for the evolution of higher forms of AI, such as AGI, and specifically claim that AGI cannot be achieved by probabilistic approaches on their own. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for large language models, adoption cycles in AI, and commercial Cognitive AI development.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: After tuberculosis and leprosy, Buruli ulcer (BU) is the third most common mycobacterial infection. Buruli ulcer begins as a localized skin lesion that progresses to extensive ulceration thus leading to functional disability, loss of economic productivity and social stigma. This study is aimed at assessing the knowledge and practices among health practitioners on the treatment of BU in the Mbonge, Ekondo Titi and Muyuka Health Districts of the South West Region of Cameroon. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that investigates participants' knowledge and practices on the treatment of BU. The study uses a qualitative method of structured questionnaires in the process of data collection. RESULTS: Seventy percent (70%) of the participants acknowledged they encounter cases of BU in their respective Hospitals or Health centers. Among these, 48% agreed they managed BU in their facilities and up to 91.7% noted that their community members are aware that BU is managed in their facility while seventy percent of the medical practitioners indicated they cannot identify the various stages of BU. Eighty-one percent of the practitioners from Muyuka HD indicated they could not identify the various stages of BU. More than 63% of the practitioners regarded BU patients as normal people in their communities however, practitioners that practiced for less than 5 years were likely not to admit BU patients in the same room with other patients. Beliefs such as being cursed (47.06%) and being possessed (29.41%) were reported by practitioners that acknowledged the existence of traditional beliefs in the community. CONCLUSION: Despite the fact that a majority of the health practitioners knew what BU is, most of them demonstrated lack of knowledge on the identification of the various stages and management of the illness. Practitioners demonstrated positive attitude towards patients although they would not admit them in the same room with other patients. Considering the poor knowledge on identification and management demonstrated by most of the practitioners, management of the disease would be inadequate and may even aggravate the patient's situation. Training and onsite mentorship on screening, identification and management of BU is therefore highly recommended amongst health personnel practicing in endemic areas.",

Ninety-eight women and eighty-four men aged 17 to 80 years old (mean age: 50) who consulted at the pain clinic were included in the study, a majority of the patients being aged between 21 and 60 years. Lower back pains and gonalgias secondary to osteo-arthritis or arthritis were more common in the North of the country, where the patients represented 57.7% of the sample, these two previous localisations along with cephalagias accounting for 52.7% of the motives for the visits. Thoracic and abdominal pains common in both men and women in the South were psychological. Patients working in the tertiary sector represented 45.3% of the patients, those of the secondary sector 24.4%, and those of the primary 20.3%. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics (NSAI) associated with WHO grade 1 and 2 analgesics were effective in 50% of cases, some of whom also needed steroidal articular infiltration. Psychological pains were soothed by amitriptyline. A specific training of doctors and paramedics in pain treatment is necessary to improve care and assistance in this area.",

    "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) signaling and incomplete inhibition of estrogen signaling may contribute to metastatic breast cancer (MBC) resistance to a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI; letrozole or anastrozole). We assessed whether combined inhibition of androgen biosynthesis with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and estradiol synthesis with exemestane (E) may be of clinical benefit to postmenopausal patients with NSAI-pretreated estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MBC. Patients (N = 297) were stratified by the number of prior therapies for metastatic disease (0-1 versus 2) and by prior NSAI use (adjuvant versus metastatic), and randomized (1 : 1 : 1) to receive oral once daily 1000 mg abiraterone acetate plus 5 mg prednisone (AA) versus AA with 25 mg E (AAE) versus 25 mg E alone (E). Each treatment arm was well balanced with regard to the proportion of patients with AR-positive breast cancer. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival, clinical benefit rate, duration of response, and overall response rate. There was no significant difference in PFS with AA versus E (3.7 versus 3.7 months; hazard ratio [ HR] = 1.1; 95% confidence interval [ CI] 0.82-1.60; P = 0.437) or AAE versus E (4.5 versus 3.7 months; HR = 0.96; 95% CI 0.70-1.32; P = 0.794). Increased serum progesterone concentrations were observed in both arms receiving AA, but not with E. Grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events associated with AA, including hypokalemia and hypertension, were less common in patients in the E (2.0% and 2.9%, respectively) and AA arms (3.4% and 1.1%, respectively) than in the AAE arm (5.8% for both). Adding AA to E in NSAI-pretreated ER+ MBC patients did not improve PFS compared with treatment with E. An AA-induced progesterone increase may have contributed to this lack of clinical activity.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), recurrence is still a concern for patients with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer (EBC). We assessed recurrence risk in real-world patients with stage II/III HR+/HER2- EBC treated with adjuvant ET. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the ConcertAI Patient360 database (January 1995 to April 2021) of patients with stage II/III HR+/HER2- EBC ≥18 years who underwent surgery and received adjuvant ET. Risk of recurrence was assessed using invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) with adapted STEEP criteria. An ET subanalysis evaluated iDFS, distant disease-free survival, and overall survival in patients receiving adjuvant non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI) vs tamoxifen. RESULTS: In the full analysis cohort (N = 3133), the risk of an iDFS event was 26.1 % at 5 years, rising to 45.0 % at 10 years. Among patients with stage II disease, the risk of an iDFS event at 5 and 10 years was 22.7 % and 40.5 %, respectively; stage III 5- and 10-year risk was 40.4 % and 62.9 %. Patients with node-negative disease had 5- and 10-year risks of 22.1 % and 36.9 %, respectively; node-positive 5- and 10-year risk was 28.9 % and 49.4 %. ET subanalysis showed improved iDFS with NSAI ± ovarian function suppression vs tamoxifen ± ovarian function suppression (HR, 0.83; 95 % CI, 0.69-0.98; p = 0.031); this trend was observed regardless of menopausal status. CONCLUSIONS: This real-world study highlights the considerable risk of recurrence with adjuvant ET in patients with stage II or III HR+/HER2- EBC (including node-negative disease) and confirms the need for improved treatment options.",

On the other hand, learning by imitation provides a simple way to acquire knowledge by watching other agents do. In order to learn more complex tasks by imitation than mere sequences of actions, a Think Aloud protocol is introduced, with a new neuro-symbolic network. The latter uses time in the same way as in a Time Delay Neural Network, and is added basic first order logic capacities. Tested on a benchmark counting task, learning is very fast, generalization is accurate, whereas there is no initial bias toward counting.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This paper explores the integration of two AI subdisciplines employed in the development of artificial agents that exhibit intelligent behavior: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Cognitive Architectures (CAs). We present three integration approaches, each grounded in theoretical models and supported by preliminary empirical evidence. The modular approach, which introduces four models with varying degrees of integration, makes use of chain-of-thought prompting, and draws inspiration from augmented LLMs, the Common Model of Cognition, and the simulation theory of cognition. The agency approach, motivated by the Society of Mind theory and the LIDA cognitive architecture, proposes the formation of agent collections that interact at micro and macro cognitive levels, driven by either LLMs or symbolic components. The neuro-symbolic approach, which takes inspiration from the CLARION cognitive architecture, proposes a model where bottom-up learning extracts symbolic representations from an LLM layer and top-down guidance utilizes symbolic representations to direct prompt engineering in the LLM layer. These approaches aim to harness the strengths of both LLMs and CAs, while mitigating their weaknesses, thereby advancing the development of more robust AI systems. We discuss the tradeoffs and challenges associated with each approach.",

The regression of the logarithm of the clinical dose with the logarithm of the ED50 for UVE gave a slope of 0.54, implying a non-parallelism of assays and a difference in mechanism. Dexamethasone did not inhibit the UVE. The parallelism of the logarithm of the clinical dose with the logarithm of the ED50 for the CET was substantially better (slope = 0.86). Dexamethasone was active in CET and its dose would be predicted by the CET regression. When only 1 variable was used for a prediction, log(CET) was a better predictor of log (clinical dose) than log(UVE). Standard methods for best regression selection indicated that even when both predictor variables were considered, log(CET) alone gave the best regression equation for predicting clinical dose. The view that inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis is the primary anti-inflammatory mechanism of NSAI in rheumatoid arthritis is discussed in terms of the findings.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess phosphate and osmolarity levels of chronically administered eye drops commercially available in Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 53 topical eye drops including 18 antiglaucoma drugs, 4 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 10 corticosteroids, 7 antihistaminics, and 14 artificial tears identified using the Vademecum Modern Medications Guideline (2018) were included in the study. Phosphate levels were assessed using Roche Cobas C501 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and the respective kits. Osmolarity was assessed using Vescor Vapro 5600 vapor pressure osmometer (Sanova Medical Systems, Vienna, Austria). Mean phosphate and osmolarity levels were obtained after averaging three measurements. Eye drops were categorized as isoosmolar, hypoosmolar and hyperosmolar based on physiologic tear osmolarity range (296.5±9.8 mOsm/L). RESULTS: The highest phosphate concentration was found in the antiglaucoma group (20.3±35.4 mmol/L), followed by antihistaminics (17.3±17.9 mmol/L), corticosteroids (15.2±19.1 mmol/L), artificial tears (0.8±1.0), and NSAIDs (0.04±0.08). Percentage of medications in the hyperosmolar category was highest in the NSAI group (75%), followed by antihistaminics (43%), corticosteroids (20%), and antiglaucoma drugs (19%). Nearly all of the artificial tear formulations were in the hypoosmolar (71%) or isoosmolar (21%) categories. CONCLUSION: Approximately 40% of glaucoma medications and approximately 60% of corticosteroid and antihistaminic medications had a phosphate concentration higher than the physiologic tear phosphate level (1.45 mmol/L).",

    "year": "2023",
    "author": "Padalkar, Parth and Huaduo, Wang and Gopal, Gupta",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Within the realm of deep learning, the interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly in the context of image classification tasks, remains a formidable challenge. To this end, we present a neurosymbolic framework, NeSyFOLD-G that generates a symbolic rule-set using the last layer kernels of the CNN to make its underlying knowledge interpretable. We find groups of similar kernels in the CNN (kernel-grouping) using the cosine-similarity score between the feature maps generated by various kernels. Once such kernel groups are found, we binarize each kernel group's output and use it to generate a rule-set using a Rule Based Machine Learning (RBML) algorithm called FOLD-SE-M. We present a novel kernel grouping algorithm and show that grouping similar kernels leads to a significant reduction in the size of the rule-set generated by FOLD-SE-M, consequently, improving the interpretability. The rule-set can be viewed as a stratified Answer Set Program wherein each predicate's truth value depends on a kernel group in the CNN. Each predicate in the rule-set is mapped to a semantic concept using a novel semantic labeling algorithm that utilizes a few semantic segmentation masks of the images used for training. The last layers of the CNN can then be replaced by this rule-set to obtain the NeSy-G model which can then be used for the image classification task. The goal-directed ASP system s(CASP) can be used to obtain the justification of any prediction made using the NeSy-G model.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series classification is an ubiquitous and widely studied problem. Due to their strong generalization capability, neural networks are suitable for this problem, but their intrinsic black-box nature often limits their applicability. Temporal decision trees are a relevant alternative to neural networks for the same task regarding classification performances while attaining higher levels of transparency and interpretability. In this work, we approach the problem of hybridizing these two techniques, and present three independent, natural hybridization solutions to study if, and in what measure, both the ability of neural networks to capture complex temporal patterns and the transparency and flexibility of temporal decision trees can be leveraged. To this end, we provide initial experimental results for several tasks in a binary classification setting, showing that our proposed neural-symbolic hybridization schemata may be a step towards accurate and interpretable models.

    "abstract": "Automated Planning and Scheduling is among the growing areas in Artificial Intelligence (AI) where mention of LLMs has gained popularity. Based on a comprehensive review of 126 papers, this paper investigates eight categories based on the unique applications of LLMs in addressing various aspects of planning problems: language translation, plan generation, model construction, multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool integration, and brain-inspired planning. For each category, we articulate the issues considered and existing gaps. A critical insight resulting from our review is that the true potential of LLMs unfolds when they are integrated with traditional symbolic planners, pointing towards a promising neuro-symbolic approach. This approach effectively combines the generative aspects of LLMs with the precision of classical planning methods. By synthesizing insights from existing literature, we underline the potential of this integration to address complex planning challenges. Our goal is to encourage the ICAPS community to recognize the complementary strengths of LLMs and symbolic planners, advocating for a direction in automated planning that leverages these synergistic capabilities to develop more advanced and intelligent planning systems.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "We propose two methods that integrate justification logic, defeasible reasoning and numerical reasoning to lay the foundations for an explainable, reason-based neuro-symbolic architecture. The core idea behind the two methods is to model two different ways in which weighing default reasons can be formalized in justification logic. The two methods both assign weights to justification terms, i.e. modal-like terms that represent reasons for propositions. The first method obtains the values of these reasons solely on the basis of the extension-based operational semantics for default justification logic. This semantics handles default reasons in such a way that it extends consistent sets of reason-formula pairs as much as possible. The second method aims for a direct comparison of reasons, where the potential conflicts between default reasons are resolved by pooling together all the applicable reasons for or against propositions. Instead of applying default steps selectively in the fashion of the operational semantics, all available default reasons are applied simultaneously and interact directly with each other. We argue that the two methods show why combining justification logic, defeasible reasoning and numerical reasoning is an intuitive and promising logical approach to explainable neuro-symbolic integration.",

    "abstract": "Background/Aims: To evaluate the treatment patterns of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients in South Korea. Methods: Using the Korean nationwide claims database, all knee OA patients in Korea during 2014 were identified by the knee OA diagnostic code (M17) or any OA diagnostic code (M15 to M19) in combination with a procedure for a knee X-ray. Patterns of medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids (CSs), analgesics, and symptomatic slow acting drugs for OA (SYS-ADOA) were analyzed. Prevalence and characteristics of knee OA patients who received a CS intra-articular injection (IAI) were also evaluated. Results: We identified 2,016,516 knee OA patients whose age (mean +/- standard deviation) was 63.2 +/- 10.8 years. The number of patients with at least one use of NSAIDs, analgesics, CS, and SYSADOA were 82.5%, 32.2%, 8.6%, and 43.4%, respectively. The use of herbal SYSADOAs was 29.7%. For regular users (medication possession ratios a >= 50%), the use of NSAI Ds was substantially decreased (48.8%), while the use of SYSADOA (37.3%) and CS (6.7%) were not significantly changed. The number of CS IAI users among knee OA patients was 0.18%; they were slightly older (64.4 +/- 10.9 vs. 63.2 +/- 10.8, p < 0.01) and more skewed towards females (75.7% vs. 71.5%, p < 0.01) than patients who had not received CS IAI. Conclusions: In Korea, the use of SYSADOA or CS in knee OA patients was relatively high. Further studies on the effectiveness and the safety of these treatment options for knee OA are needed.",

    "year": "2025",
    "author": "Padalkar, Parth and Gopal, Gupta",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Recent neuro-symbolic approaches have successfully extracted symbolic rule-sets from CNN-based models to enhance interpretability. However, applying similar techniques to Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains challenging due to their lack of modular concept detectors and reliance on global self-attention mechanisms. We propose a framework for symbolic rule extraction from ViTs by introducing a sparse concept layer inspired by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). This linear layer operates on attention-weighted patch representations and learns a disentangled, binarized representation in which individual neurons activate for high-level visual concepts. To encourage interpretability, we apply a combination of L1 sparsity, entropy minimization, and supervised contrastive loss. These binarized concept activations are used as input to the FOLD-SE-M algorithm, which generates a rule-set in the form of logic programs. Our method achieves a 5.14% better classification accuracy than the standard ViT while enabling symbolic reasoning. Crucially, the extracted rule-set is not merely post-hoc but acts as a logic-based decision layer that operates directly on the sparse concept representations. The resulting programs are concise and semantically meaningful. This work is the first to extract executable logic programs from ViTs using sparse symbolic representations. It bridges the gap between transformer-based vision models and symbolic logic programming, providing a step forward in interpretable and verifiable neuro-symbolic AI.",

    "abstract": "Several endocrine-based therapies have recently been evaluated as treatments for premenopausal women with hormone-receptor-positive/human-epidermal-growth-factor-receptor 2 negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (mBC). We conducted a systematic review and assessed the feasibility of an indirect treatment comparison (ITC) to characterize the comparative efficacy of endocrine-based therapies in this setting. A systematic literature review (SLR) of Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and key conferences was performed to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) satisfying the following criteria: (a) included pre/perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC, (b) included endocrine-based therapies, (c) reported efficacy, safety, or quality of life outcomes, and (d) was published in 2007 or later (when HER2 testing was standardized). The clinical and methodological similarities across trials were assessed to evaluate the feasibility of an ITC. Four RCTs (PALOMA-3, MONARCH-2, KCSG BR10-04 and MONALEESA-7) and eight regimens (palbociclib + fulvestrant + goserelin, fulvestrant + goserelin, abemaciclib + fulvestrant + gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist [GnRHa], fulvestrant + GnRHa, anastrozole + goserelin, goserelin, ribociclib + NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin and NSAI/tamoxifen + goserelin) were selected. MONALEESA-7 was the only phase 3 trial investigating endocrine-based therapies as first-line in only pre/perimenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC; the other three trials focused on the ET-failure setting and their pre/perimenopausal populations were relatively small. ITCs were methodologically unfeasible due to critical differences in treatment settings and lack of common comparators across trials. Therefore, we were not able to characterize the relative efficacy of the different endocrine-based therapies available in the premenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC setting. This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of the available trial evidence on the efficacy and safety of endocrine-based therapies for premenopausal women with HR+/HER2- mBC. Only four trials have reported relevant data in this setting, and MONALEESA-7 is currently the only trial focused on premenopausal HR+ HER2- mBC in the first-line setting.",

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks have led to major advances in image recognition, language translation, data mining, and game playing, there are well-known limits to the paradigm such as lack of explainability, difficulty of incorporating prior knowledge, and modularity. Neuro symbolic hybrid systems have recently emerged as a straightforward way to extend deep neural networks by incorporating ideas from symbolic reasoning such as computational logic. In this paper, we propose a list desirable criteria for neuro symbolic systems and examine how some of the existing approaches address these criteria. We then propose an extension to generalized annotated logic that allows for the creation of an equivalent neural architecture comprising an alternate neuro symbolic hybrid. However, unlike previous approaches that rely on continuous optimization for the training process, our framework is designed as a binarized neural network that uses discrete optimization. We provide proofs of correctness and discuss several of the challenges that must be overcome to realize this framework in an implemented system.",

    "abstract": "The efficient disassembly of end-of-life electric vehicle batteries(EOL-EVBs) is crucial for green manufacturing and sustainable development. The current pre-programmed disassembly conducted by the Autonomous Mobile Manipulator Robot(AMMR) struggles to meet the disassembly requirements in dynamic environments, complex scenarios, and unstructured processes. In this paper, we propose a Battery Disassembly AMMR(BEAM-1) system based on NeuralSymbolic AI. It detects the environmental state by leveraging a combination of multi-sensors and neural predicates and then translates this information into a quasi-symbolic space. In real-time, it identifies the optimal sequence of action primitives through LLM-heuristic tree search, ensuring high-precision execution of these primitives. Additionally, it employs positional speculative sampling using intuitive networks and achieves the disassembly of various bolt types with a meticulously designed end-effector. Importantly, BEAM-1 is a continuously learning embodied intelligence system capable of subjective reasoning like a human, and possessing intuition. A large number of real scene experiments have proved that it can autonomously perceive, decide, and execute to complete the continuous disassembly of bolts in multiple, multi-category, and complex situations, with a success rate of 98.78%. This research attempts to use NeuroSymbolic AI to give robots real autonomous reasoning, planning, and learning capabilities. BEAM-1 realizes the revolution of battery disassembly. Its framework can be easily ported to any robotic system to realize different application scenarios, which provides a ground-breaking idea for the design and implementation of future embodied intelligent robotic systems.",

    "abstract": "This work studies the class of algorithms for learning with side-information that emerges by extending generative models with embedded context-related variables. Using finite mixture models (FMMs) as the prototypical Bayesian network, we show that maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) of parameters through expectation-maximization (EM) improves over the regular unsupervised case and can approach the performances of supervised learning, despite the absence of any explicit ground-truth data labeling. By direct application of the missing information principle (MIP), the algorithms' performances are proven to range between the conventional supervised and unsupervised MLE extremities proportionally to the information content of the contextual assistance provided. The acquired benefits regard higher estimation precision, smaller standard errors, faster convergence rates, and improved classification accuracy or regression fitness shown in various scenarios while also highlighting important properties and differences among the outlined situations. Applicability is showcased with three real-world unsupervised classification scenarios employing Gaussian mixture models. Importantly, we exemplify the natural extension of this methodology to any type of generative model by deriving an equivalent context-aware algorithm for variational autoencoders (VAs), thus broadening the spectrum of applicability to unsupervised deep learning with artificial neural networks. The latter is contrasted with a neural-symbolic algorithm exploiting side information.",

    "abstract": "The paper presents the utilisation of a neurosymbolic system designed and developed for health monitoring and diagnosis of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles within a complete modular and distributed architecture. The neuro-symbolic system, named NSS has been developed within the IST European project ADVOCATE II and is part of the global architecture designed in the project. The paper focuses on the application of the ADVOCATE 11 solution on two different experimental Autonomous Underwater Vehicles: the VORTEX underwater vehicle owned and operated by Ifremer and the experimental MiniC AUV developed and operated by ATLAS ELEKTRONIK GmbH. The paper briefly describes the ADVOCATE H modular and distributed architecture, and presents in detail some study cases for the two underwater applications, and the added-value of such the approach for AUV. The NSS system developed and used within the architecture is dedicated to diagnosis of thrusters and actuators. NSS is a neuro-symbolic system which allow to simultaneously work on symbolic rules and on neural networks, using transformation techniques. The symbolic rules are compiled at the initialisation of the system into a neural structure, further trained with representative examples. The trained neural network is then used for real-time diagnosis during the AUV mission execution.",

In order to achieve the required peak reflectivity of more than 65 %, the ellipsoidal collector was coated with a highly reflective, laterally graded multilayer using the dc magnetron sputtering system ``NESY '' . A maximum reflectivity of the laterally graded multilayer of more than 65 % was achieved for radii smaller than 220 mm. For radii between 230 mm and 320 mm the reflectivity decreases to a minimum of 58 %. The targeted wavelength remains constant at (13.50 +/- 0.05) nm over the entire collector surface which is well within the tight specifications for high volume manufacturing.",

    "abstract": "In a previous paper the preparation has been described, by three different techniques, of microparticles made of Eudragit((R)) RS 100 and RL 100 containing a NSAI agent, Tolmetin. Freely flowing microparticles failed to affect significantly the in vitro drug release, which displayed a similar dissolution profile after micro-encapsulation to the free drug powder. Microparticles were then converted into tablets and the effect of compression on drug deliver, as well as that of the presence of co-additives, was studied in the present work. Furthermore, microparticles were also prepared by adding MgO to the polymer matrix, to reduce the sensitivity of the drug to pH changes during its dissolution. Similarly, magnesium stearate was also used for microparticle formation as a droplet stabilizer, in order to reduce particle size and hinder rapid drug release. A mathematical evaluation, by using two semi-empirical equations, was applied to evaluate the influence of dissolution and diffusion phenomena upon drug release from microparticle tablets.",

This is done in the context of a real-world practice of curators of conversational systems who often embed taxonomically-structured meta-knowledge into their documentation. The paper provides evidence that the practice is quite common among curators, that is used as part of their collaborative practices, and that the embedded knowledge can be mined by algorithms. Further, this meta-knowledge can be integrated, using neuro-symbolic algorithms, to the machine learning-based conversational system, to improve its run-time accuracy and to enable tools to support curatorial tasks. Those results point towards new ways of designing development tools which explore an integrated use of code and documentation by machines.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To assess the working conditions of Cambodian male nurses specialised in anaesthesia and intensive care (NSAIs), degree of satisfaction, whether training was suited to the Cambodian needs and practical application of training. Study design: Prospective survey. Persons: Two training years including 30 NSAIs. Method: External assessors evaluated working conditions, practice of anaesthesia, analysed logbooks and theatre reports, organised semi-directive interviews and examinations using clinical cases. Results: Out of the 30 NSAIs, 28 had an appointment, mainly in anaesthesia (80% of their activity) and three-quarters of them felt that their skills were appreciated by their superiors. Seventeen had some form of responsibility in the management of a department. For the administration of an anaesthetic, 13 NSAIs of the second year had achieved an acceptable level of performance and resolved effectively 85% of the submitted cases. Twenty-two NSAIs reported difficulty in applying techniques learned during their training to real working conditions. The causes were poor equipment, poor organisation and poor relations with the hierarchy. The latter cause decreased the capacity to take appropriate decisions, which was the most common error made by the second year NSAIs. Finally, as their wages remained unchanged, 19 out of the 28 NSAIs were obliged to look for an additional source of income. Conclusion: This survey shows the medium-term effectiveness of an NSAI training programme basing on teaching and public health principles and organised in the humanitarian aid sector.

    "abstract": "The landscape of computing technologies is changing rapidly, straining existing software engineering practices and tools. The growing need to produce and maintain increasingly complex multi-architecture applications makes it crucial to effectively accelerate and automate software engineering processes. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are expected to work hand-in-hand with human developers. Therefore, it becomes critical to model the software accurately, so that the AI and humans can share a common understanding of the problem. In this contribution, firstly, an in-depth overview of these interconnected challenges faced by modern software engineering is presented. Secondly, to tackle them, a novel architecture based on the emerging WebAssembly technology and the latest advancements in neuro-symbolic AI, autonomy, and knowledge graphs is proposed. The presented system architecture is based on the concept of dynamic, knowledge graph-based WebAssembly Twins, which model the software throughout all stages of its lifecycle. The resulting systems are to possess advanced autonomous capabilities, with full transparency and controllability by the end user. The concept takes a leap beyond the current software engineering approaches, addressing some of the most urgent issues in the field. Finally, the efforts towards realizing the proposed approach as well as future research directions are summarized.",

    "abstract": "To what extent can LLMs be used as part of a cognitive model of language generation? In this paper, we approach this question by exploring a neuro-symbolic implementation of an algorithmic cognitive model of referential expression generation by Dale & Reiter (1995). The symbolic task analysis implements the generation as an iterative procedure that scaffolds symbolic and gpt-3.5-turbo-based modules. We compare this implementation to an ablated model and a one-shot LLM-only baseline on the A3DS dataset (Tsvilodub & Franke, 2023). We find that our hybrid approach is cognitively plausible and performs well in complex contexts, while allowing for more open-ended modeling of language generation in a larger domain.",

The trend is going towards the integration of more and more sensors into automation systems, which will reach a number of sensors comparable to the amount of sensory receptors in the human body in the not too distant future. While today's technical systems cannot cope with such a flood of information to be processed rapidly, these challenges are mastered exceptionally well by the human brain. Based on this observation, in prior work, a biologically inspired model for sensor data processing has been proposed [ 1]. This so-called neuro-symbolic information processing model is based on a functional model of the human perception system. Here, an extension of this concept to spatial and temporal aspects of perception is presented. The challenges for solving these tasks as well as the strategies to master these challenges based on perception-nets are presented.",

    "author": "Potteiger, Nicholas and Xenofon, Koutsoukos",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Machine learning and reinforcement learning are increasingly used to solve complex tasks in autonomous systems. However, autonomous agents represented by large neural networks are not transparent leading to their assurability and trustworthiness becoming critical challenges. Large models also result in a lack of interpretability which causes severe obstacles related to trust in autonomous agents and human-machine teaming. In this paper, we leverage the hierarchical structure of behavior trees and hierarchical reinforcement learning to develop a neurosymbolic model architecture for autonomous agents. The proposed model, referred to as Evolving Behavior Trees (EBTs), integrates the required components to represent the learning tasks as well as the switching between tasks to achieve complex long-term goals. We design an agent for autonomous navigation and we evaluate the approach against a state-of-the-art hierarchical reinforcement learning method using a Maze Simulation Environment. The results show autonomous agents represented by EBTs can be trained efficiently. The approach incorporates explicit safety constraints into the model and incurs significantly fewer safety violations during training and execution. Further, the model provides explanations for the behavior of the autonomous agent by associating the state of the executing EBT with agent actions.",

The measurand was the two terminal-pair capacitance at a frequency of 1000 Hz, for a measuring voltage of 15 V. The BIPM was the pilot laboratory, and the comparison forms part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K14.b. The results from the NSAI-NML and the BIPM were found to be in good agreement, with a difference smaller than the relative expanded uncertainty (95 % confidence, k = 2) of 0.66 x 10(-6).",

    "abstract": "Neurules are a type of neuro-symbolic rules integrating neurocomputing and production rules. Each neurule is represented as an adaline unit. Neurules exhibit characteristics such as modularity, naturalness and ability to perform interactive and integrated inferences and provide explanations for reached conclusions. One way of producing a neurule base is through conversion of an existing symbolic rule base yielding an equivalent but more compact rule base. The conversion process merges symbolic rules having the same conclusion into one or more neurules. Because of the inability of the adaline unit to handle inseparability, more than one neurule for each conclusion may be produced by splitting the initial set of symbolic rules into subsets. This paper presents research work improving the conversion process in terms of runtime and number of produced neurules. First, we show how easier it is to construct a neurule base than a connectionist one. Second, we present alternative rule set splitting methods. Finally, we define criteria concerning the ability or inability to convert a rule set into a single, equivalent, but more compact rule. With application of such mergability criteria, the conversion process of symbolic rules into neurules becomes more time-efficient. All the aforementioned are supported by experimental results.",

This paper explores aspects regarding the reasoning mechanisms of two neuro-symbolic approaches, that is, neurules and connectionist expert systems. Both provide reasoning and explanation facilities.

Connectionist expert systems give pre-eminence to the connectionist component. This paper explores reasoning aspects about neurules and connectionist expert systems that have not been previously addressed. As far as neurules are concerned, an aspect playing a role in conflict resolution (i.e., order of neurules) is explored. Experimental results show an improvement in reasoning efficiency. As far as connectionist expert systems are concerned, variations of the reasoning mechanism are explored. Experimental results are presented for them as well showing that one of the variations generally performs better than the others.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 22,700 Canadian women were expected to be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012. Despite improvements in screening and adjuvant treatment options, a substantial number of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer will continue to develop metastatic disease during or after adjuvant endocrine therapy. Guidance on the selection of endocrine therapy for patients with HR+ disease that is negative for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-) and that has relapsed or progressed on earlier nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy is of increasing clinical importance. Exemestane, fulvestrant, and tamoxifen are approved therapeutic options in this context. Four phase III trials involving 2876 patients-EFECT, SOFEA, CONFIRM, and BOLERO-2-have assessed the efficacy of various treatment options in this clinical setting. Data from those trials suggest that standard-dose fulvestrant (250 mg monthly) and exemestane are of comparable efficacy, that doubling the dose of fulvestrant from 250 mg to 500 mg monthly results in a 15% reduction in the risk of progression, and that adding everolimus to exemestane (compared with exemestane alone) results in a 57% reduction in the risk of progression, albeit with increased toxicity. Multiple treatment options are now available to women with HR+ HER2- advanced breast cancer recurring or progressing on earlier NSAI therapy, although current clinical trial data suggest more robust clinical efficacy with everolimus plus exemestane. Consideration should be given to the patient's age, functional status, and comorbidities during selection of an endocrine therapy, and use of a proactive everolimus safety management strategy is encouraged.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer in whom disease progresses or there is recurrence while taking a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) are usually treated with exemestane (EXE), but no single standard of care exists in this setting. The BOLERO-2 trial demonstrated that adding everolimus (EVE) to EXE improved progression-free survival (PFS) while maintaining quality of life when compared with EXE alone. Because many women with HR(+) advanced breast cancer are elderly, the tolerability profile of EVE plus EXE in this population is of interest. PATIENTS AND METHODS: BOLERO-2, a phase III randomized trial, compared EVE (10 mg/d) and placebo (PBO), both plus EXE (25 mg/d), in 724 postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced breast cancer recurring/progressing after treatment with NSAIs. Safety and efficacy data in elderly patients are reported at 18-month median follow-up. RESULTS: Baseline disease characteristics and treatment histories among the elderly subsets (≥ 65 years, n = 275; ≥ 70 years, n = 164) were generally comparable with younger patients. The addition of EVE to EXE improved PFS regardless of age (hazard ratio, 0.59 [≥ 65 years] and 0.45 [≥ 70 years]). Adverse events (AEs) of special interest (all grades) that occurred more frequently with EVE than with PBO included stomatitis, infections, rash, pneumonitis, and hyperglycemia. Elderly EVE-treated patients had similar incidences of these AEs as did younger patients but had more on-treatment deaths. CONCLUSION: Adding EVE to EXE offers substantially improved PFS over EXE and was generally well tolerated in elderly patients with HR(+) advanced breast cancer. Careful monitoring and appropriate dose reductions or interruptions for AE management are recommended during treatment with EVE in this patient population.",

    "abstract": "Recent interest in Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) has led to a plethora of approaches based on reinforcement learning, inductive logic programming and graph embeddings. In particular, rule-based KBC has led to interpretable rules while being comparable in performance with graph embeddings. Even within rule-based KBC, there exist different approaches that lead to rules of varying quality and previous work has not always been precise in highlighting these differences. Another issue that plagues most rule-based KBC is the non-uniformity of relation paths: some relation sequences occur in very few paths while others appear very frequently. In this paper, we show that not all rule-based KBC models are the same and propose two distinct approaches that learn in one case: 1) a mixture of relations and the other 2) a mixture of paths. When implemented on top of neuro-symbolic AI, which learns rules by extending Boolean logic to real-valued logic, the latter model leads to superior KBC accuracy outperforming state-of-the-art rule-based KBC by 2-10% in terms of mean reciprocal rank. Furthermore, to address the non-uniformity of relation paths, we combine rule-based KBC with graph embeddings thus improving our results even further and achieving the best of both worlds.",

    "abstract": "Recent work on neuro-symbolic inductive logic programming has led to promising approaches that can learn explanatory rules from noisy, real-world data. While some proposals approximate logical operators with differentiable operators from fuzzy or real-valued logic that are parameter-free thus diminishing their capacity to fit the data, other approaches are only loosely based on logic making it difficult to interpret the learned rules . In this paper, we propose learning rules with the recently proposed logical neural networks (LNN). Compared to others, LNNs offer strong connection to classical Boolean logic thus allowing for precise interpretation of learned rules while harboring parameters that can be trained with gradient-based optimization to effectively fit the data. We extend LNNs to induce rules in first-order logic. Our experiments on standard benchmarking tasks confirm that LNN rules are highly interpretable and can achieve comparable or higher accuracy due to their flexible parameterization.",

    "abstract": "Computational argumentation (CA) has emerged, in recent decades, as a powerful formalism for knowledge representation and reasoning in the presence of conflicting information, notably when reasoning non-monotonically with rules and exceptions. Much existing work in CA has focused, to date, on reasoning with given argumentation frameworks (AFs) or, more recently, on using AFs, possibly automatically drawn from other systems, for supporting forms of XAI. In this short paper we focus instead on the problem of learning AFs from data, with a focus on neuro-symbolic approaches. Specifically, we overview existing forms of neuro-argumentative (machine) learning, resulting from a combination of neural machine learning mechanisms and argumentative (symbolic) reasoning. We include in our overview neuro-symbolic paradigms that integrate reasoners with a natural understanding in argumentative terms, notably those capturing forms of non-monotonic reasoning in logic programming. We also outline avenues and challenges for future work in this spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Attenuation of the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAI) drugs was attributed to inhibition of systemic or renal vasodilator prostaglandin synthesis or a combination of both. Indomethacin is a NSAI drug with both renal and extrarenal cyclooxygenase inhibition properties. Sulindac is a relatively selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor said not to affect urinary prostaglandin excretion. The relative effect on blood pressure of 4 wk treatment, with indomethacin 25 mg 3.times. daily and sulindac 200 mg 2 .times. daily was examined in a randomized placebo controlled trial in 26 hypertensive subjects. In 9 patients treated with indomethacin, supine blood pressure rose 11 mm Hg systolic and 4 mm Hg diastolic by the end of the 1st wk, whereas 9 subjects treated with sulindac showed a fall in blood pressure similar to the trend seen in placebo-treated subjects. Indomethacin treatment inhibited renal cyclooxygenase with a 78% reduction in urinary prostaglandin E2 excretion and 89% suppression of plasma renin activity. Neither measurement was affected by sulindac. Extrarenal cyclooxygenase activity was inhibited by both indomethacin and sulindac with serum thromboxane B2 decreasing by 96% and 69%, respectively. The pressor effect of NSAI drugs is predominantly related to renal cyclooxygenase inhibition. The lack of effect of sulindac on blood pressure may make it a safer therapeutic option if NSAI drug therapy is necessary in the hypertensive patient.",

The modules in the program can call several ready-made computer vision models to achieve object detection, or write image processing programs by themselves, and finally connect them to achieve drone video question answering.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Cyber resilience is a complementary concept to cybersecurity, focusing on the preparation, response, and recovery from cyber threats that are challenging to prevent. Organizations increasingly face such threats in an evolving cyber threat landscape. Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience.",

    "abstract": "Humans exhibit distinct yet complementary cognitive capacities for logical and relational reasoning, foundational to understanding language processing and meaning representation. These capacities find mathematical expression in two prominent computational frameworks: formal semantics, which maps expressions to truth values through logical structures; distributional semantics, which represents meaning through contextual relationships in vector spaces. This research establishes well-defined mathematical compatibilities between these philosophies of language by constructing structural correspondences. These correspondences: (1) preserve core semantic relationships; (2) respect compositionality and logical dependencies; (3) allow for embeddings of intensional structures (e.g., modality and tense) into continuous representations. Consequently, a reconciliation emerges between `meaning as reference' and `meaning as use' while retaining computational tractability. Five fundamental results follow: (1) a delineation and classification of mathematical linguistics as distinct from yet complementary to computational linguistics, itself distinct yet complementary to natural language processing; (2) a categorical framework organizing extensional and intensional models under a cohesive theoretical structure, such that semantic representation and processing remain modular and order-independent; (3) proofs of structure-preserving homomorphisms between formal and distributional semantics, demonstrating compatibility between symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches while maintaining compositionality and logical dependencies, subject to certain limitations; (4) a generalized vector logic compatible with compositionality that respects the representation of logical operators within distributional spaces; (5) a generalized grounding problem and proposed heuristic for identifying grounding problems, with which we show that neurosymbolic semantics is, indeed, grounded. These results show that logical and relational reasoning, though distinct cognitive processes, are mathematically compatible, albeit at the cost of linearity. This research establishes a linguistically grounded and cognitively plausible foundation for investigating reasoning and semantic representation in human and machine language processing, framed as a possible solution to the symbol grounding problem in neurosymbolic artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To compare oil of evening primrose (OEP) and topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) with respect to safety, effectiveness, rapidity of response, cost effectiveness and acceptability in the treatment of breast pain. Study Design: An open, non-randomised, comparative study of topical (NSAI) gel versus OEP was carried out, over a period of one year. Patients and Methods: Fifty female patients attending the outpatient department with moderate to severe breast pain were given one of the two agents alternatively, after selection. Results: Results showed that out of 25 patients treated with OEP, 64% had a clinically significant response after three months of treatment, compared with 92% with topical NSAIDs. Only one patient (4%) had side effects with OEP, while no patient had side effects with topical NSAIDs. Twenty per cent and seventy per cent showed acceptability as far as costs were concerned and mode of administration respectively, with OEP. The acceptability rate was 68% and 96% respectively, with topical NSAIDs. Conclusion: This study has shown topical NSAIDs to be safe, effective, rapid and acceptable mode of treatment for cyclical and non-cyclical mastalgia",

    "year": "2021",
    "author": "Racharak, Teeradaj",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Data-driven and knowledge-driven methods are two mainstream techniques in the pursuit of developing artificial intelligence systems. While data-driven methods seek to develop a decision model from observations in the real world, they are difficult to provide an explanation for the results in human terms. On the other hand, knowledge-driven methods that employ symbolic reasoning based on formal semantics of a knowledge-base are thus more interpretable and explainable, while lacking an ability to deal with incomplete modeling of the structured knowledge-bases. This work aims to tackle these issues on ontology similarity by proposing a general framework that combines the strengths of both approaches for measuring semantic similarity of concepts in a description logic (DL) ontology. More specifically, a neuro-symbolic integrated framework is defined to exploit the pre-trained word embeddings with semantic definitions in an ontology to yield an explainable degree of concept similarity. To demonstrate its applicability, we develop a concrete similarity measure sim(epsilon) conforming to the proposed framework and also introduce an efficient algorithm that can extract an explanation for why such a degree is indicated. The correctness is shown by analyzing theoretical properties that it guarantees to preserve and also by performing an empirical evaluation with a medical ontology SNOMED CT and a medical pre-trained embedding BioWordVec. The results show that our proposed method remains both interpretability and explainability while achieving comparable performance, relative to the state-of-the-art approaches in the data and knowledge-driven methods.",

Direct gastroscopic observations are probably the only definitive way of assessing damage to the stomach. The radiochromium-labeled red cell technique has severe limitations which would appear to limit its use as a satisfactory clinical method for determining blood loss. There is also the safety factor, i.e., exposure to radioactivity which must also be considered in clinical applications of this technique. In view of this, and the fact that there is often poor correspondence of results obtained with this technique and gastroscopy or studies in animals, serious consideration should be given to avoiding the use of this technique. From the large number of studies which have been reported, it appears that aspirin and salicylates have multiple actions in the development of gastric mucosal damage. Several main points and a variety of secondary factors are summarized.",

Aspirin-induced gastric damage is characterized by a variety of physical and biochemical changes induced in the gastric mucosa which occur at different stages after administration of the drug. Aspirin only causes gastric ulceration and massive haemorrhage in the stomach when the stomach has been sensitized by the prior exposure to moderate stress conditions (which may resemble anxiety or psychologic stress). A model of ulcer development in which aspirin or other N.S.A.I. drugs are given to rats or pigs exposed to brief periods of stress has been described. Using this more sensitive assay procedures can be explored for reducing the gastric damaging effects of N.S.A.I. drugs. One such procedure involves chemical modification of the carboxylic acid moiety of aspirin.",

The simple screening procedures in healthy animals, i.e., detection of lesions, may not entirely reveal the extent or potential for gastro-intestinal toxicity. Improvements are suggested in detecting gastro-intestinal toxicity by: employing a sensitive stress-sensitizing assay technique; studying irritancy in disease-stressed species; selection of species with pseudo-human stomachs, e.g., pigs; performing fine-structural and biochemical (DNA-cell exfoliation, luminal ion marker or ion concentration measurements; selecting times for irritancy studies from knowledge of the pattern of absorption and metabolism of the drug.",

Some NSAI drugs, which apparently are relatively non-ulcerogenic in a sensitive gastric ulcer assay and the analgesic drugs paracetamol and dextropropoxyphene (which are non-ulcerogenic) did not inhibit biosynthesis of sulfated mucus glycoproteins in vivo. A relationship is therefore shown between ulcerogenicity of NSAI drugs and inhibitory effects on gastric mucus biosynthesis. Some potent intestinal ulcerogens (e.g., indomethacin) inhibit incorporation of [ 35S]sulfate into glycoproteins from the upper intestinal mucosa. Aspirin stimulates incorporation of [ 35S]sulfate into intestinal mucus glycoproteins. Inhibition of biosynthesis of sulfated gastric mucus glycoproteins by aspirin apparently is dependent on the presence of high concentrations of salicylates in the mucosal tissue, a consequence of combined inhibitory capacity of aspirin, salicylate and possibly traces of metabolites in the mucosa and due to inhibition of sulfotransferase activity in vitro. Aspirin inhibits incorporation into gastric glycoproteins of [ 14C]acetate, but not [ 14C]threonine, but the effect on [ 14C]acetate incorporation may be due to redistribution of the isotope in vivo.",

    "abstract": "A comparison was performed of structure with gastric ulcerogenic activity of a range of acidic and 1 group of non-acidic (tetrazine) non-steroid anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs with the object of establishing the physico-chemical properties of these drugs involved in gastric ulceration. The results with non-acetylated salicylate analogs show that an increase in lipophilic properties of 3-substituted salicylates was associated with decreased gastric ulceration. The converse was, however, observed with 4- and 5-substituted salicylates, i.e. increased lipid solubility was associated with enhanced gastric ulceration. O-Acetylation increased the ulcerogenic activity of all salicylates (except 4-tert-butyl derivative). Lipid solubility was also found to influence the gastric ulcerogenic activity of other NSAI drugs in different ways. It is also apparent that electronic factors (which reflect changes in the dissociation constants) and the position of electron-withdrawing substituents on aromatic groups variously influences the ulcerogenic activity in different groups of NSAI drugs. The presence of carboxylic acid moiety is a major factor in ulcerogenesis by acidic NSAI drugs. Laser Raman spectroscopy of these drugs shows that there is a profound alteration in the frequency of absorption of the carbonyl group in the solid state and in concentrated solutions at pH 6-7. Such changes reflect an intermolecular interaction between the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of carboxylic acids and suggest that these drugs exist as dimers under these conditions. Dimeric NSAI drugs may initiate gastric damage by the breaking of bonds between the dimers and reformation of bonds between the drugs and membrane phospholipids so disrupting the latter and leading to permeability changes.",

    "abstract": "A critical analysis has been performed of reports published on the incidence of gastro-intestinal (GI) side-effects found in arthritic patients being treated with non-steroid anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs. The results show the following: 1. The incidence of GI ulceration (as revealed by gastroscopy) and haemorrhage in arthritic patients taking NSAI drugs may be higher than suspected from clinical trial data. 2. Incidence of all GI side-effects (including ulceration and haemorrhage) may be lower with some of the new NSAI drugs than with traditional drugs (e.g. aspirin, indomethacin and phenylbutazone). 3. Arthritic patients may be more susceptible to the ulcerogenic actions of NSAI drugs. Experiments with animals, together with evidence from clinical studies, indicate that stress factors and the presence of decreased mucosal resistance in the diseased state may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of the GI tract towards the ulcerogenicity of NSAI drugs. 4. Comparison of data on gastroscopic observations in man with the author's data on the effects of NSAI drugs in stress-sensitized rats shows the latter technique appears to be a useful means of predicting the ulcerogenic potential of NSAI drugs in man. The comparison has also been used to predict the ulcerogenicity of drug - alcohol combinations; alcohol being a common ulcerogen consumed by many patients. Some NSAI drugs with low ulcerogenic activity (i.e. azapropazone, benoxaprofen and fenclofenac) in the stressed-rat assay show little or no interaction with alcohol. These studies using laboratory animals show the importance of employing conditions to mimic environmental factors (e.g. stress and alcohol consumption) which might predispose individuals to ulcerogenic or other side-effects of NSAI drugs. From these studies it appears possible to construct 'predictive profiles' of the relative ulcerogenicity of NSAI drugs which may be applicable to the clinical situation in man.",

To establish if conventional or novel anti-inflammatory (AI) agents could modify the actions of CAT-IL-1 and thus be useful for understanding the mode of action of these components, the effects were determined of a range of AI compounds on the release by CAT-IL-1 of proteoglycans (PG's) from bovine nasal cartilage. In vitro, conventional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) compounds were, with the exception of 10-100 microM hydroxychloroquine, weak (e.g. diclofenac, indomethacin, fenclofenac, effective at concentrations of 100-500 microM), or with some drugs actually ineffective, as inhibitors of CAT-IL-1-mediated PG release. Antioxidants were ineffective as inhibitors of this PG release. Drugs which modify gene transcription were potent inhibitors of CAT-IL-1-induced PG release, emphasizing the importance of gene expression in the actions of these mediators. The importance of prostaglandin metabolism on CAT-IL-1 actions and the in vivo effects of AI are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The severe granulomatous reactions in the liver which occur following infestation by adult Schistosoma mansoni are largely initiated by invading eosinophils and monocytes. The present studies were designed to investigate the possibility that (a) anti-inflammatory drugs could be employed beneficially to attenuate the liver granulomatous reactions in schistosomiasis, and (b) that part of the therapeutic effects of anti-schistosomal (AS) drugs might be due to possible influences on arachidonate metabolism. Therefore the effects wre determined of (a) AS as compared with NSAI drugs on eicosanoid metabolism in isolated human peripheral leucocyte populations, and (b) electron-microscopic changes in the livers of mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni in response to AS and/or NSAI drugs. Of the AS drugs only praziquantel (10-100 .mu.M) inhibited 5-HETE production by the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. No effects were observed of this or the other AS drugs on prostaglandin production. In S. mansoni infected mice, praziquantel (250 mg/kg/d), given orally with indomethacin (5 mg/kg/d) for 5 days did not improve the inflammatory reactions around worms or eggs of schistosomes. Furthermore, both indomethacin (5 mg/kg/d) alone and benoxaprofen (20 mg/kg/d for 5 days) elicited liver changes suggestive of specific liver damage by these drugs. These results suggest tha liver pathology may be enhanced by NSAI drugs perhaps as a consequence of the liver metabolism of these drugs being compromised. Their use to modify inflammatory reactions at the peak of liver schistosome infections may thus be contraindicated.",

Oral administration of highly ulcerogenic drugs (e.g. aspirin, diclofenac, indomethacin, piroxicam) to rats causes rapid damage to surface and gastric mucous cells, selective parietal cell damage, and extensive disruption of endothelial cells of submucosal microcapillaries (especially with aspirin) with accompanying extravasation of blood cell components. These changes are coincident with depressed levels of PGE2/6-keto-PGF1 alpha (measured by GC/MS or RIA) and uptake of the drugs (measured by scintillation counting or HPLC). Low ulcerogenic NSAI drugs (e.g. azapropazone, benoxaprofen and fenclofenac) causes very little damage to the surface mucosal cells. Azapropazone has been found to be well absorbed, and benoxaprofen and fenclofenac somewhat more slowly, so for the latter two drugs their low rate of absorption might also be a factor in their reduced ulcerogenicity. Aspirin, azapropazone and benoxaprofen have been shown to reduce 5-HETE levels (RIA), although the latter two drugs were more effective than aspirin. Thus, they result in the inhibition of PG production, by cyclo-oxygenase inhibition (with potential adverse effects from excess oxyradical and/or production of HETE's) with inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway. The time-sequence of changes induced by single oral doses of indomethacin or other NSAI drugs on the ultrastructure and the prostanoid metabolism of the pig gastric mucosa parallelled those seen in the rat. Attempts to determine whether co-administration of NSAI drugs might reduce the inhibition of PG cyclo-oxygenase by more potent inhibitors (e.g. indomethacin) have been explored as a means for reducing the gastric ulcerogenicity of the latter. The results suggest that pharmacokinetic factors may largely account for the reduced ulcerogenicity of these drug mixtures.",

Aspirin (200 mg/kg p.o.) and indomethacin (10 mg/kg p.o.) produced ultrastructural signs of damage at 10-60 min to the surface mucous cells, parietal cells and endothelial cells of sub-mucosal capillaries coincident with the relatively rapid absorption of the radiolabelled drugs and reduction in the mucosal content of PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Azapropazone (100 mg/kg p.o.) failed to elicit mucosal damage either ultrastructurally or even visually up to 23 h after dosing and did not affect the content of PG's even though the drug was present in the mucosa in sufficient concentration to elicit reduction in prostaglandin synthesis in vitro. Benoxaprofen (110 mg/kg p.o.) reduced the content of PGE2 and somewhat variably, that of 6-keto PGF1 alpha, was more slowly absorbed c.f. aspirin and indomethacin, but failed to elicit appreciable mucosal damage. These results show that while reduction in PG synthesis is a factor in the development of damage by ulcerogenic drugs, it appears that the rate of absorption or other biochemical effects (including e.g. influences on the production of oxyradicals or 5-lipoxygenase products of eicosanoid metabolism) may contribute to the relatively low irritancy of drugs such as azapropazone or benoxaprofen.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the capabilities of Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), as a large language model (LLM), for diagnosing glaucoma using the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) dataset, and comparing the diagnostic capability of ChatGPT 3.5 and ChatGPT 4.0. DESIGN: Prospective data collection study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3170 eyes of 1585 subjects from the OHTS were included in this study. METHODS: We selected demographic, clinical, ocular, visual field, optic nerve head photo, and history of disease parameters of each participant and developed case reports by converting tabular data into textual format based on information from both eyes of all subjects. We then developed a procedure using the application programming interface of ChatGPT, a LLM-based chatbot, to automatically input prompts into a chat box. This was followed by querying 2 different generations of ChatGPT (versions 3.5 and 4.0) regarding the underlying diagnosis of each subject. We then evaluated the output responses based on several objective metrics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1 score. RESULTS: Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3.5 achieved AUC of 0.74, accuracy of 66%, specificity of 64%, sensitivity of 85%, and F1 score of 0.72. Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 4.0 obtained AUC of 0.76, accuracy of 87%, specificity of 90%, sensitivity of 61%, and F1 score of 0.92. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of ChatGPT 4.0 in diagnosing glaucoma based on input data from OHTS was promising. The overall accuracy of ChatGPT 4.0 was higher than ChatGPT 3.5. However, ChatGPT 3.5 was found to be more sensitive than ChatGPT 4.0. In its current forms, ChatGPT may serve as a useful tool in exploring disease status of ocular hypertensive eyes when specific data are available for analysis. In the future, leveraging LLMs with multimodal capabilities, allowing for integration of imaging and diagnostic testing as part of the analyses, could further enhance diagnostic capabilities and enhance diagnostic accuracy.

    "abstract": "With the prolification of multimodal interaction in various domains, recently there has been much interest in text based image retrieval in the computer vision community. However most of the state of the art techniques model this problem in a purely neural way, which makes it difficult to incorporate pragmatic strategies in searching a large scale catalog especially when the search requirements are insufficient and the model needs to resort to an interactive retrieval process through multiple iterations of question-answering. Motivated by this, we propose a neural-symbolic approach for a one-shot retrieval of images from a large scale catalog, given the caption description. To facilitate this, we represent the catalog and caption as scene-graphs and model the retrieval task as a learnable graph matching problem, trained end-to-end with a REINFORCE algorithm. Further, we briefly describe an extension of this pipeline to an iterative retrieval framework, based on interactive questioning and answering.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models mark a transformative advancement in artificial intelligence, aiming to unify perception, natural language understanding, and embodied action within a single computational framework. This foundational review presents a comprehensive synthesis of recent advancements in Vision-Language-Action models, systematically organized across five thematic pillars that structure the landscape of this rapidly evolving field. We begin by establishing the conceptual foundations of VLA systems, tracing their evolution from cross-modal learning architectures to generalist agents that tightly integrate vision-language models (VLMs), action planners, and hierarchical controllers. Our methodology adopts a rigorous literature review framework, covering over 80 VLA models published in the past three years. Key progress areas include architectural innovations, parameter-efficient training strategies, and real-time inference accelerations. We explore diverse application domains such as humanoid robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical and industrial robotics, precision agriculture, and augmented reality navigation. The review further addresses major challenges across real-time control, multimodal action representation, system scalability, generalization to unseen tasks, and ethical deployment risks. Drawing from the state-of-the-art, we propose targeted solutions including agentic AI adaptation, cross-embodiment generalization, and unified neuro-symbolic planning. In our forward-looking discussion, we outline a future roadmap where VLA models, VLMs, and agentic AI converge to power socially aligned, adaptive, and general-purpose embodied agents. This work serves as a foundational reference for advancing intelligent, real-world robotics and artificial general intelligence. >Vision-language-action, Agentic AI, AI Agents, Vision-language Models",

    "abstract": "We view information extraction from document images as a complex problem that requires a combination of 1) state of the art deep learning vision models for detection of entities and primitive relations, 2) symbolic background knowledge that expresses prior information of spatial and semantic relationships, using the entities and primitive relations from the neural detectors, and 3) learning of symbolic extraction rules using one, or few examples of annotated document images. Several challenges arise in ensuring that this neuro-symbolic software stack works together seamlessly. These include vision-based challenges to ensure that the documents are ``seen '' at the appropriate level of detail to detect entities; symbolic representation challenges in identifying primitive relations between the entities identified by the vision system; learning-based challenges of identifying the appropriate level of symbolic abstraction for the retrieval rules, the need to identify background knowledge that is relevant to the documents being analyzed, and learning general symbolic rules in data-deficient domains. In this paper, we describe how we meet some of these challenges in the design of our document-reading platform. In particular, we focus on use cases with multiple templates which additionally involves finding structurally similar images in large heterogeneous document image collections. An adaptive lattice based template allocation module was utilized for evaluating document similarity based on both textual content and document structure. A knowledge graph is used for capturing document structure and a relational rule learning system is employed on the knowledge graph for generating extraction rules. Experiments on a publicly shared data-set 1 of 1400 trade finance documents demonstrates the viability of the proposed system.",

    "abstract": "This paper summarises recent work in artificial intelligence (Rawbone et al. 2006), and outlines some interrelated initial research with computer games, proposing potentiality. Interactive Causation Agent (ICA), an unsupervised neurosymbolic model based on a theory of interactive causal computation, is defined, which offers a nonalgorithmic computational approach to problems in the algorithmic computing of interaction in computer games. Technological advancement of interaction in computer games (for example, object-orientated programming and development of more sophisticated hardware and software interfaces) seems to be contributing toward nonalgorithmic practices, where computation is not predefined, finite, or serial. Finally, nonalgorithmic interactive computation leads to discussion of the Frame Problem in computer games.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Acoustic power and oscillation amplitudes of radial oscillations computed for a solar model are compared with solar seismic observations. The oscillations are assumed stochastically excited by turbulence. The numerical computations are based upon a theoretical formulation of the power going into solar like oscillation modes as proposed by Samadi et al. (2000) in a companion paper. This formulation allows to investigate several assumptions concerning properties of the stellar turbulence. We find that the entropy source plays a dominant role in the stochastic excitation compared with the Reynold stress source in agreement with Goldreich et al. (1994). We consider several turbulent kinetic energy spectra suggested by different observations of the solar granulation. Differences between turbulent spectra manifest themselves by large differences in the computed oscillation powers at high oscillation frequency. Two free parameters which are introduced in the description of the turbulence enter the expression for the acoustic power. These parameters are adjusted in order to fit to the solar observations of the surface velocity oscillations. The best fit is obtained with the kinetic energy spectrum deduced from the observations of the solar granulation by Nesis et al. (1993); the corresponding adjusted parameters are found to be compatible with the theoretical upper limit which can be set on these parameters. The adopted theoretical approach improves the agreement between solar seismic observations and numerical results.",

    "abstract": "Exemestane (Exe) in combination with Everolimus (Eve) represents an important treatment option for patients diagnosed with hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which was previously treated with non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI). Data from unselected populations may be useful for defining the optimal therapeutic algorithm within a clinical setting. Data from 264 HR+, HER2-MBC patients who received Exe-Eve treatment in combination, following the failure of NSAIs was retrospectively analyzed. Different lines of endocrine treatment (ET) were investigated to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the treatment within the 'everyday clinical practice' population. The disease control rate (DCR) was 73.1%, with no statistically significant difference among the different settings. At a median follow-up of 42 months, the median progression free survival (PFS) was 11.6, 9.7 and 7.5 months for patients treated with Exe-Eve as first, second or third line therapy, respectively. There was a statistically significant correlation with younger age, no previous adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), no previous adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET), HT duration ≥36 months, involvement of liver and/or lung, no prior CT for metastatic disease and PS=0 at the start of treatment. The median overall survival (OS) was 33.0 months; at a median follow-up of 67 months, the median OS was 43.1, 31.7 and 27.9 months in patients treated with Exe-Eve in first, second or third line therapy, respectively. On multivariate analysis, diabetes and previous CT for metastatic disease were revealed to correlate with a worse outcome. Conversely, the presence of mucositis was significantly associated with long-term survival. Overall, Exe-Eve was typically well tolerated and the majority toxicities were G1 or 2, while treatment discontinuation due to unacceptable toxicity was only required in 5.7% of patients. Despite the limitations due to the observational nature of this study, the findings suggest that treatment with Exe-Eve is an active and safe therapeutic option for endocrine-sensitive MBC patients in a real-world clinical setting, regardless of treatment lines.",

The paper further presents a compelling experiment where a NEOLAF agent, built as a problem-solving agent, is fed with complex math problems from the open-source MATH dataset.

The antagonistic activity of ibuprofen appears unrelated to its NSAI drug activity because other NSAI drugs such as indomethacin and tolmetin have minimal antagonistic activity. Heating the cultured endothelial cells to 42 degrees C stimulates greater release of the inhibitor in a shorter period of time. This plasmin inhibitor, which is produced by endothelial cells, may contribute to postburn vascular occlusion, leading to secondary progressive necrosis in burn-traumatized patients.",

    "year": "2025",
    "author": "Rodriguez, Jaime de Miguel and Sancho, Caparrini Fernando",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Although neural-symbolic techniques for symbol grounding in sensory data have shown significant effectiveness, they still require substantial training. This article revisits symbolic-only approaches by introducing a new algorithm for creating hierarchical concept structures from spatial sensory data. The method is based on Bateson's idea of difference as the fundamental element of concept formation. By leveraging this principle, the algorithm extracts atomic features from raw data through basic sequential comparisons within a stream of multivariate numerical values. Experiments carried out on a set of common objects indicate that the method can successfully discriminate and assimilate categories as needed without training. The results show that the model improves on the neural networks it has been tested against, which required more than 400 training examples for the same task. The results also show that the model can generate rich conceptual structures and human-like representations, which (i) facilitate high composability, (ii) support formal reasoning, (iii) inherently enable generalisation, and (iv) possess potential for generative behaviour. Consequently, this approach offers a compelling contribution to symbol grounding and neural-symbolic research by providing a seamless algorithm to bridge perception and conceptual knowledge.",

    "year": "2020",
    "author": "Rodriguez, Magdalena Bofill and Anne, Lethaby and Cindy, Farquhar and James, Duffy",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Background Within the context of heavy menstrual bleeding, pandemics impact upon women's assessment and treatment by healthcare providers. Objectives To summarise the evidence from Cochrane Reviews evaluating interventions for heavy menstrual bleeding that are commonly available during pandemics. Methods We sought published Cochrane Reviews, evaluating interventions that can continue during pandemics for women with heavy menstrual bleeding with no known underlying cause. We identified Cochrane Reviews by searching the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews in June 2020. The primary outcome was menstrual bleeding. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, patient satisfaction, side effects, and serious adverse events. We undertook the selection of systematic reviews, data extraction, and quality assessment in duplicate. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. We assessed review quality using the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) 2 tool, and the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using GRADE methods. Main results We included four Cochrane Reviews, with 11 comparisons, data from 44 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and 3196 women. We assessed all the reviews to be high quality. Non -steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAI Ds) NSAIDs may be more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding than placebo (mean difference (MD) -124 mL per cycle, 95% confidence interval (CI) -186 to -62 mL per cycle; 1 RCT, 11 women; low-certainty evidence). Mefenamic acid may be similar to naproxen (MD 21 mL per cycle, 95% CI -6 to 48 mL per cycle; 2 RCTs, 61 women; low-certainty evidence), and NSAIDs may be similar to combined hormonal contraceptives for heavy menstrual bleeding (MD 25 mL per cycle, 95% CI -22 to 73 mL per cycle; 1 RCT, 26 women; low-certainty evidence). NSAIDs may be be less effective in reducing menstrual bleeding than antifibrinolytics (relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.85; 2 RCTs, 161 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether NSAIDs reduce menstrual blood loss more than short-cycle progestogens (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32; 1 RCT 32 women; very low-certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics Antifibrinolytics appear to be more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding than placebo (MD-53 mL per cycle, 95% CI-63 to-44 mL per cycle; 4 RCTs, 565 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics may be similar to placebo on the incidence of side effects (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.18; 1 RCT, 297 women; low-certainty evidence), and they are probably similar on the incidence of serious adverse events (thrombotic events; RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.00 to 2.46; 2 RCT, 468 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics may be more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding than short-cycle progestogen (MD-111 mL per cycle, 95% CI-178 mL to-44 mL per cycle; 1 RCT, 46 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether antifibrinolytics are similar to shortcycle progestogens on quality of life (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.64; 1 RCT, 44 women; very low-certainty evidence), patient satisfaction (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.39; 1 RCT, 42 women; very low-certainty evidence), or side effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12; 3 RCTs, 211 women; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether antifibrinolytics are more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding when compared with long-cycle progestogen (MD-9 points per cycle, 95% CI-30 to 12 points per cycle; 2 RCTs, 184 women; low-certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics may increase self-reported improvement in menstrual bleeding when compared with long-cycle medroxyprogesterone acetate (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.61; 1 RCT, 94 women; low-certainty evidence). Antifibrinolytics may be similar to long-cycle progestogens on quality of life (MD 5, 95% CI-2.49 to 12.49; 1 RCT, 90 women; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether antifibrinolytics are similar to long-cycle progestogens on side effects (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.00; 2 RCTs, 184 women; very low-certainty evidence). There were no trials comparing antifibrinolytics to combined hormonal contraceptives. Combined hormonal contraceptives Combined hormonal contraceptives appearto be more effective for heavy menstrual bleeding than placebo or no treatment (RR 13.25, 95% CI 2.94 to 59.64; 2 RCTs, 363 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Combined hormonal contraceptives are probably similar to placebo on the incidence of side effects (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.90 to 2.60; 2 RCTs, 411 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Progestogens There were no trials comparing progestogens to placebo. Limitations in the evidence included risk of bias in the primary RCTs, inconsistency between the primary RCTs, and imprecision in effect estimates. Authors' conclusions There is moderate-certainty evidence that antifibrinolytics and combined hormonal contraceptives reduce heavy menstrual bleeding compared with placebo. There is low-certainty evidence that NSAIDs reduce heavy menstrual bleeding compared with placebo. There is low-certainty evidence that antifibrinolytics are more effective in reducing heavy menstrual bleeding when compared with NSAIDs and short-cycle progestogens, but we are unable to draw conclusions about the effects of antifibrinolytics compared to long-cycle progestogens, on low-certainty evidence.",

The paper argues that incorporating insights from human cognition and psychology, as embodied by a computational cognitive architecture, can help develop systems that are more capable, more reliable, and more human-like. It emphasizes the importance of the dual-process architecture and the hybrid neuro-symbolic approach in addressing the limitations of current LLMs. In the opposite direction, the paper also highlights the need for an overhaul of computational cognitive architectures to better reflect advances in AI and computing technology. Overall, the paper advocates for a multidisciplinary, mutually beneficial approach towards developing better models both for AI and for understanding the human mind.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, yet they often struggle with spatial reasoning. This paper presents a novel neural-symbolic framework that enhances LLMs' spatial reasoning abilities through iterative feedback between LLMs and Answer Set Programming (ASP). We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets: StepGame and SparQA, implementing three distinct strategies: (1) direct prompting baseline, (2) Facts+Rules prompting, and (3) DSPy-based LLM+ASP pipeline with iterative refinement. Our experimental results demonstrate that the LLM+ASP pipeline significantly outperforms baseline methods, achieving an average 82% accuracy on StepGame and 69% on SparQA, marking improvements of 40-50% and 8-15% respectively over direct prompting. The success stems from three key innovations: (1) effective separation of semantic parsing and logical reasoning through a modular pipeline, (2) iterative feedback mechanism between LLMs and ASP solvers that improves program rate, and (3) robust error handling that addresses parsing, grounding, and solving failures. Additionally, we propose Facts+Rules as a lightweight alternative that achieves comparable performance on complex SparQA dataset, while reducing computational overhead.Our analysis across different LLM architectures (Deepseek, Llama3-70B, GPT-4.0 mini) demonstrates the framework's generalizability and provides insights into the trade-offs between implementation complexity and reasoning capability, contributing to the development of more interpretable and reliable AI systems.",

    "year": "2007",
    "author": "Rosaci, D.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "For a software information agent, operating on behalf of a human owner and belonging to a community of agents, the choice of communicating or not with another agent becomes a decision to take, since communication generally implies a cost. Since these agents often operate as recommender systems, on the basis of dynamic recognition of their human owners' behaviour and by generally using hybrid machine learning techniques, three main necessities arise in their design, namely (i) providing the agent with an internal representation of both interests and behaviour of its owner, usually called ontology; (ii) detecting inter-ontology properties that can help an agent to choose the most promising agents to be contacted for knowledge-sharing purposes; (iii) semi-automatically constructing the agent ontology, by simply observing the behaviour of the user supported by the agent, leaving to the user only the task of defining concepts and categories of interest. We present a complete MAS architecture, called connectionist learning and inter-ontology similarities (CILIOS), for supporting agent mutual monitoring, trying to cover all the issues above. CILIOS exploits an ontology model able to represent concepts, concept collections, functions and causal implications among events in a multi-agent environment; moreover, it uses a mechanism capable of inducing logical rules representing agent behaviour in the ontology by means of a connectionist ontology representation, based on neural-symbolic networks, i.e., networks whose input and output nodes are associated with logic variables.

The commonest ones are non-specific erythematous eruptions, sometimes with a phototoxic distribution, and urticaria. Vasculitis and severe bullous eruptions (Stevens-Johnson's syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis) are rare but may have severe outcomes. The overall incidence of cutaneous reactions is about the same for all NSAI, 1 to 3 p. 100, during the clinical studies performed before marketing the drug, but this increases afterwards (up to 45 p. 100 for Benoxaprofen). Drugs with long half-lives may carry a higher risk for severe cutaneous reactions. NSAI are now the main cause of drug induced TEN. Urticarial reactions seem related to pharmacological phenomena while the pathogenic events leading to other kinds of skin reactions remain unknown. An hypersensitivity reaction is postulated. The therapeutic value of corticosteroids for the severe cutaneous side effects of drugs is still controversial.",

We focus on a one-sided setting with a partially-informed agent using discrete, data-driven observations and another, fully-informed agent. We present a new method, called one-sided NS-HSVI, for approximate solution of one-sided NS-POSGs, which exploits the piecewise constant structure of the model. Using neural network pre-image analysis to construct finite polyhedral representations and particle-based representations for beliefs, we implement our approach and illustrate its practical applicability to the analysis of pedestrian-vehicle and pursuit-evasion scenarios.",

We formalise notions of equilibria for these models and present algorithms to synthesise them. Focusing on the finite-horizon setting, and (global) social welfare subgame-perfect optimality, we consider two distinct types: Nash equilibria and correlated equilibria. We first show that an exact solution based on backward induction may yield arbitrarily bad equilibria. We then propose an approximation algorithm called frozen subgame improvement, which proceeds through iterative solution of nonlinear programs. We develop a prototype implementation and demonstrate the benefits of our approach on two case studies: an automated car-parking system and an aircraft collision avoidance system.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a neuro-symbolic framework called weighted Signal Temporal Logic Neural Network (wSTL-NN) that combines the characteristics of neural networks and temporal logics. Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (wSTL) formulas are recursively composed of subformulas that are combined using logical and temporal operators. The quantitative semantics of wSTL is defined such that the quantitative satisfaction of subformulas with higher weights has more influence on the quantitative satisfaction of the overall wSTL formula. In the wSTL-NN, each neuron corresponds to a wSTL subformula, and its output corresponds to the quantitative satisfaction of the formula. We use wSTL-NN to represent wSTL formulas as features to classify time series data. STL features are more explainable than those used in classical methods. The wSTL-NN is end-to-end differentiable, which allows learning of wSTL formulas to be done using back-propagation. To reduce the number of weights, we introduce two techniques to sparsify the wSTL-NN.We apply our framework to an occupancy detection time-series dataset to learn a classifier that predicts the occupancy status of an office room.",

    "abstract": "Most existing Time series classification (TSC) models lack interpretability and are difficult to inspect. Interpretable machine learning models can aid in discovering patterns in data as well as give easy-to-understand insights to domain specialists. In this study, we present Neuro-Symbolic Time Series Classification (NSTSC), a neuro-symbolic model that leverages signal temporal logic (STL) and neural network (NN) to accomplish TSC tasks using multi-view data representation and expresses the model as a human-readable, interpretable formula. In NSTSC, each neuron is linked to a symbolic expression, i.e., an STL (sub)formula. The output of NSTSC is thus interpretable as an STL formula akin to natural language, describing temporal and logical relations hidden in the data. We propose an NSTSC-based classifier that adopts a decision-tree approach to learn formula structures and accomplish a multiclass TSC task. The proposed smooth activation functions for wSTL allow the model to be learned in an end-to-end fashion. We test NSTSC on a real-world wound healing dataset from mice and benchmark datasets from the UCR time-series repository, demonstrating that NSTSC achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, NSTSC can generate interpretable formulas that match with domain knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The trade-off between expressiveness and interpretability remains a core challenge when building human-centric predictive models for classification and decision-making. While symbolic rules offer interpretability, they often lack expressiveness, whereas neural networks excel in performance but are known for being black boxes. In this paper, we show a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic programs can bridge this gap. In the proposed LLM-based Symbolic Programs (LSPs), the pretrained LLM with natural language prompts provides a massive set of interpretable modules that can transform raw input into natural language concepts. Symbolic programs then integrate these modules into an interpretable decision rule. To train LSPs, we develop a divide-and-conquer approach to incrementally build the program from scratch, where the learning process of each step is guided by LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of LSPs in extracting interpretable and accurate knowledge from data, we introduce IL-Bench, a collection of diverse tasks, including both synthetic and real-world scenarios across different modalities. Empirical results demonstrate LSP's superior performance compared to traditional neurosymbolic programs and vanilla automatic prompt tuning methods. Moreover, as the knowledge learned by LSP is a combination of natural language descriptions and symbolic rules, it is easily transferable to humans (interpretable), and other LLMs, and generalizes well to out-of-distribution samples.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades there has been a growing interest in logic-based machine learning, where the goal is to learn a logic program, called a hypothesis, that together with a given background knowledge explains a set of examples. Although logic-based machine learning has traditionally addressed the task of learning definite logic programs (with no negation), our logic-based machine learning approaches have extended this field to a wider class of formalisms for knowledge representation, captured by the answer set programming (ASP) semantics. The ASP formalism is truly declarative and due to its non-monotonicity it is particularly well suited to commonsense reasoning. It allows constructs such as choice rules, hard and weak constraints, and support for default inference and default assumptions. Choice rules and weak constraints are particularly useful for modelling human preferences, as the choice rules can represent the choices available to the user, and the weak constraints can specify which choices a human prefers. In the recent years we have made fundamental contributions to the field of logic-based machine learning by extending it to the learning of the full class of ASP programs and the first part of this talk provides an introduction to these results and to the general field of learning under the answer set semantics, referred here as learning from answer sets (LAS). To be applicable to real-world problems, LAS has to be tolerant to noise in the data, scalable over large search spaces, amenable to user-defined domain-specific optimisation criteria and capable of learning interpretable knowledge from structured and unstructured data. The second part of this talk shows how these problems are addressed by our recently proposed FastLAS approach for learning Answer Set Programs, which is targeted at solving restricted versions of observational and non-observational predicate learning from answer sets tasks. The advanced features of our family of LAS systems have made it possible to solve a variety of real-world problems in a manner that is data efficient, scalable and robust to noise. LAS can be combined with statistical learning methods to realise neuro-symbolic solutions that perform both fast, low-level prediction from unstructured data, and high-level logic-based learning of interpretable knowledge. The talk concludes with presenting two such neuro-symbolic solutions for respectively solving image classification problems in the presence of distribution shifts, and discovering sub-goal structures for reinforcement learning agents.",

    "abstract": "There is little data on the long term evolution of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and of associated conditions. We therefore studied the evolution of IBS patients in a single tertiary center during a long interval of time. Methods. We carried out a retrospective study based on the survey of patients records. We analyzed the records of symptoms, therapy, associated diseases, as consigned at follow-up visits for an interval of 4 years in average (2008-2011). Results. A cohort of 114 patients with IBS diagnosed based on Rome III criteria were included (29 men and 85 women), age 19-85 years (mean age: 43.45 years). Urban patients were predominant. The main three symptoms were: abdominal pain, bowel disorders (constipation, diarrhea) and bloating. IBS -constipation (IBS -C) is associated with a favorable course of symptoms (increasing the number of stools, decrease intensity of abdominal pain and bloating) after treatment and IBS diarrhea (IBS -D) is associated with variable symptoms after treatment (p = 0.031). Using trimebutin or mebeverin in association with other drugs for one month correlates with a favorable evolution of symptoms after treatment and monotherapy is associated with fluctuating symptoms (p<0.001). Favorable symptoms are associated with the use of probiotics in combination, but not in monotherapy (p<0.001). Favorable evolution of symptoms is also associated with the use of anxiolytics in combination. Persistence of symptoms after treatment was correlated with the presence or absence of depression. The absence of depression was correlated with a favorable evolution of symptoms (p = 0.005). IBS-C is associated at limit (marginal significance) with hemorrhoidal disease (p = 0.56). 33 patients (29%) -received monotherapy (trimebutin or mebeverin or probiotics); 81 patients (71%) received combined therapy: (trimebutin or mebeverin or probiotics) + anxiolytics or proton pump inhibitors (PPI) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) or spasmolitics. The most common associated diseases observed in patients with IBS were: depression (27.19%), dyslipidemia (25.43%), hemorrhoidal disease (22.80%) and fibromyalgia (21%). Conclusions. The highest response rate was obtained with trimebutin or mebeverin + anxiolitics + probiotics. The most frequent disease associated with IBS was depression. Other diseases with a high incidence: dyslipidemia, hemorrhoidal disease and fibromyalgia. Further studies are needed to analyze the link between IBS and some associated diseases.",

    "abstract": "AIM: The main aim is to describe the cases of mechanical lumbalgia in relation to clinical and demographic variables, in the period between February and June 1989. The collateral purpose is to analyse the relationship between analgesic/NAI treatment as regards the time needed to resolve the problem. DESIGN: This is an observational prospective study. The cases included under the second aim are distributed at random. SITE. The study was carried out in the Primary Care Centre of Deltebre, a rural town of 10,000 inhabitants. PATIENTS AND OTHERS PARTICIPANTS: The consultations for rheumatoid lumbar pain were 355. Of these, 183 were first visits, which were the object of the descriptive study. Out of these, 125 were lumbalgias of the posterior branch and are the target population of the analytical study. INTERVENTIONS: Paracetamol (on its own or with codeine) taken orally was used as an analgesic. Piroxicam, Indometazine, Ketoprofen or Diclofenac taken orally, rectally or intramuscularly was used as an anti-inflammatory. MAIN RESULTS AND MEASUREMENTS: In cases between the ages of 40 and 49 in the case of men, and of 40 and 59 in the case of women, an increase in relation to the municipal census was observed, with p < 0.01 and 0.001. There was no difference in the time of resolution between the cases treated with analgesics and those treated with NSAI. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies will have to analyse the increase in lumbalgias in the 40 to 59 age-group. The number of cases off-work signifies a health cost. Drug treatment plays no part in the resolution, which agrees with a previous reference.",

    "abstract": "Inertial navigation provides a small footprint, low-power, and low-cost pathway for localization in GPS-denied environments on extremely resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) platforms. Traditionally, application-specific heuristics and physics-based kinematic models are used to mitigate the curse of drift in inertial odometry. These techniques, albeit lightweight, fail to handle domain shifts and environmental non-linearities. Recently, deep neural-inertial sequence learning has shown superior odometric resolution in capturing non-linear motion dynamics without human knowledge over heuristic-based methods. These AI-based techniques are data-hungry, suffer from excessive resource usage, and cannot guarantee following the underlying system physics. This paper highlights the unique methods, opportunities, and challenges in porting real-time AI-enhanced inertial navigation algorithms onto IoT platforms. First, we discuss how platform-aware neural architecture search coupled with ultra-lightweight model backbones can yield neural-inertial odometry models that are 31-134× smaller yet achieve or exceed the localization resolution of state-of-the-art AI-enhanced techniques. The framework can generate models suitable for locating humans, animals, underwater sensors, aerial vehicles, and precision robots. Next, we showcase how techniques from neurosymbolic AI can yield physics-informed and interpretable neural-inertial navigation models. Afterward, we present opportunities for fine-tuning pre-trained odometry models in a new domain with as little as 1 minute of labeled data, while discussing inexpensive data collection and labeling techniques. Finally, we identify several open research challenges that demand careful consideration moving forward.",

    "abstract": "Prompting large language models has enabled significant recent progress in multi-step reasoning over text. However, when applied to text generation from semi-structured data (e.g., graphs or tables), these methods typically suffer from low semantic coverage, hallucination, and logical inconsistency. We propose MURMUR, a neuro-symbolic modular approach to text generation from semi-structured data with multi-step reasoning. MURMUR is a best-first search method that generates reasoning paths using: (1) neural and symbolic modules with specific linguistic and logical skills, (2) a grammar whose production rules define valid compositions of modules, and (3) value functions that assess the quality of each reasoning step. We conduct experiments on two diverse data-to-text generation tasks like WebNLG and LogicNLG. These tasks differ in their data representations (graphs and tables) and span multiple linguistic and logical skills. MURMUR obtains significant improvements over recent few-shot baselines like direct prompting and chain-of-thought prompting, while also achieving comparable performance to fine-tuned GPT-2 on out-of-domain data. Moreover, human evaluation shows that MURMUR generates highly faithful and correct reasoning paths that lead to 26% more logically consistent summaries on LogicNLG, compared to direct prompting.",

    "abstract": "Modern video understanding systems excel at tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and short video retrieval. However, as video analysis becomes increasingly central to real-world applications, there is a growing need for proactive video agents for the systems that not only interpret video streams but also reason about events and take informed actions. A key obstacle in this direction is temporal reasoning: while deep learning models have made remarkable progress in recognizing patterns within individual frames or short clips, they struggle to understand the sequencing and dependencies of events over time, which is critical for action-driven decision-making. Addressing this limitation demands moving beyond conventional deep learning approaches. We posit that tackling this challenge requires a neuro-symbolic perspective, where video queries are decomposed into atomic events, structured into coherent sequences, and validated against temporal constraints. Such an approach can enhance interpretability, enable structured reasoning, and provide stronger guarantees on system behavior, all key properties for advancing trustworthy video agents. To this end, we present a grand challenge to the research community: developing the next generation of intelligent video agents that integrate three core capabilities: (1) autonomous video search and analysis, (2) seamless real-world interaction, and (3) advanced content generation. By addressing these pillars, we can transition from passive perception to intelligent video agents that reason, predict, and act, pushing the boundaries of video understanding.",

    "abstract": "We present a theoretical study of degradation mechanisms for photoinduced oxidation in organic polymers in the condensed phase, using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an example. Applying density functional theory with a hybrid density functional and periodic boundary conditions that account for steric effects and permit the modeling of interchain chemical reactions, we investigate reaction pathways that may lead to the oxidation of the thiophene backbone as a critical step toward disrupting the polymer conjugation. We calculate energy barriers for reactions of the P3HT backbone with oxidizing agents including the hydroxyl radical (OH˙), hydroperoxide (ROOH), and the peroxyl radical (ROO˙), following a UV-driven radical reaction starting at the α-carbon of the alkyl side chain as suggested by infrared (IR) and X-ray photoemission (XPS) spectrosocopy studies. The results strongly suggest that an attack of OH˙ on sulfur in P3HT is unlikely to be thermodynamically favored. On the other hand, an attack of a peroxyl radical on the side chain on the P3HT backbone may provide low barrier reaction pathways to photodegradation of P3HT and other polymers with side chains. The condensed phase setting is found to qualitatively affect predictions of degradation processes.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This work belongs to the field of hybrid systems for Artificial Intelligence (AI). It concerns the study of ``gradual '' rules, which makes it possible to represent correlations and modulation relations between variables. We propose a set of characteristics to identify these gradual rules, and a classification of these rules into ``direct '' rules and ``modulation '' rules. In neurobiology, pre-synaptic neuronal connections lead to gradual processing and modulation of cognitive information. While taking as a starting point such neurobiological data, we propose in the field of connectionism the use of ``Sigma-Pi '' connections to allow gradual processing in AI systems. In order to represent as well as possible the modulation processes between the inputs of a network, we have created a new type of connection, ``Asymmetric Sigma-Pi '' (ASP) units. These models have been implemented within a pre-existing hybrid neuro-symbolic system, the INSS system, based on connectionist nets of the ``Cascade Correlation '' type. The new hybrid system thus obtained, INSSGradual, allows the learning of bases of examples containing gradual modulation relations. ASP units facilitate the extraction of gradual rules from a neural network.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Everolimus in combination with endocrine therapy (ET) was formerly approved as 2nd-line therapy in HR(+)/HER2(-) advanced breast cancer (aBC) patients (pts) progressing during or after a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). Since this approval, the treatment landscape of aBC has changed dramatically, particularly with the arrival of CDK 4-6 inhibitors. Endocrine monotherapy after progression to CDK4/6 inhibitors has shown a limited progression-free survival (PFS), below 3 months. Evidence of the efficacy of everolimus plus ET after CDK4/6 inhibitors is scarce. METHODS: A retrospective observational study of patients with aBC treated with everolimus and ET beyond CDK4/6-i progression compiled from February 2015 to December 2022 in 4 Spanish hospitals was performed. Clinical and demographic data were collected from medical records. The main objective was to estimate the median progression-free survival (mPFS). Everolimus adverse events (AE) were registered. Quantitative variables were summarized with medians; qualitative variables with proportions and the Kaplan-Meier method were used for survival estimates. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one patients received everolimus plus ET (exemestane: 96, fulvestrant: 54, tamoxifen: 10, unknown: 1) after progressing on a CDK4/6 inhibitor. The median follow-up time was 15 months (interquartile range: 1-56 months). The median age at diagnosis was 49 years (range: 35-90 years). The estimated mPFS was 6.0 months (95%CI 5.3-7.8 months). PFS was longer in patients with previous CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy lasting for > 18 months (8.7 months, 95%CI 6.6-11.3 months), in patients w/o visceral metastases (8.0 months, 95%CI 5.8-10.5 months), and chemotherapy-naïve in the metastatic setting (7.2 months, 95%CI 5.9-8.4 months). CONCLUSION: This retrospective analysis cohort of everolimus plus ET in mBC patients previously treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor suggests a longer estimated mPFS when compared with the mPFS with ET monotherapy obtained from current randomized clinical data. Everolimus plus ET may be considered as a valid control arm in novel clinical trial designs.",

    "abstract": "LESSONS LEARNED: The levels of circulating follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, estriol, estradiol, and estrone remained unchanged after a 12-week treatment with 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in postmenopausal women receiving nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors for hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. These results support the safety of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel for the treatment of bothering symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in breast cancer survivors. The results provide clinicians with confidence in the use of this product in women who do not experience symptom relief with nonhormonal remedies. BACKGROUND: Symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy associated with treatment with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) negatively impact patients' quality of life and may affect adherence to NSAIs. Vaginal estrogens effectively improve these symptoms, although their safe use in breast cancer survivors remains unclear. METHODS: Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer receiving NSAI and moderate-to-severe vaginal dryness were randomized to 0.005% estriol vaginal gel or placebo for 12 weeks. Circulating estrogens, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH), were analyzed at baseline and at weeks 1, 3, 8, and 12. The primary safety outcome was the variation in serum FSH from baseline to week 12. RESULTS: Sixty-one women (mean age, 59 years) enrolled in the study. Small oscillations were observed in FSH and LH, although they were always maintained within the postmenopausal range. No significant differences were found in the variation of FSH and LH between baseline and week 12 from the physiological variation observed before treatment. Women receiving 0.005% estriol vaginal gel had slightly increased estriol levels at weeks 1 and 3, with a subsequent reduction until normalizing at week 12; estradiol and estrone remained the below limit-of-quantitation in almost all samples. CONCLUSION: Ultralow-dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel did not significantly influence estrogens, FSH, and LH levels in women with breast cancer receiving NSAI. A transient negligible absorption of estriol and a nonsignificant variation of FSH after 12 weeks were observed. These findings provide confidence for the safe use of 0.005% estriol vaginal gel in women with breast cancer with an indication for treatment with vaginal estrogens.",

    "abstract": "Customizable image retrieval from large datasets remains a critical challenge, particularly when preserving spatial relationships within images. Traditional hashing methods, primarily based on deep learning, often fail to capture spatial information adequately and lack transparency. In this paper, we introduce NeuroHash, a novel neuro-symbolic framework leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to enable highly customizable, spatially-aware image retrieval. NeuroHash combines pre-trained deep neural network models with HDC-based symbolic models, allowing for flexible manipulation of hash values to support conditional image retrieval. Our method includes a self-supervised context-aware HDC encoder and novel loss terms for optimizing lower-dimensional bipolar hashing using multilinear hyperplanes. We evaluate NeuroHash on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art hashing methods, as measured by mAP@5K scores and our newly introduced metric, mAP@5Kr, which assesses spatial alignment. The results highlight NeuroHash's ability to achieve competitive performance while offering significant advantages in flexibility and customization, paving the way for more advanced and versatile image retrieval systems.",

    "abstract": "Achieving machine common sense has been a longstanding problem within Artificial Intelligence. Thus far, benchmark data sets that are grounded in a theory of common sense and can be used to conduct rigorous, semantic evaluations of common sense reasoning (CSR) systems have been lacking. One expectation of the AI community is that neuro-symbolic reasoners can help bridge this gap towards more dependable systems with common sense. We propose a novel benchmark, called Theoretically Grounded common sense Reasoning (TG-CSR), modeled as a set of question answering instances, with each instance grounded in a semantic category of common sense, such as space, time, and emotions. The benchmark is few-shot i.e., only a few training and validation examples are provided in the public release to avoid the possibility of overfitting. Results from recent evaluations suggest that TG-CSR is challenging even for state-of-the-art statistical models. Due to its semantic rigor, this benchmark can be used to evaluate the common sense reasoning capabilities of neuro-symbolic systems.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Epidemiological data suggest that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may protect against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unfortunately, recent trials have failed in providing compelling evidence of neuroprotection. Discussion as to why NSAIDs effectivity is uncertain is ongoing. Possible explanations include the view that NSAIDs and other possible disease-modifying drugs should be provided before the patients develop symptoms of AD or cognitive decline. In addition, NSAID targets for neuroprotection are unclear. Both COX-dependent and independent mechanisms have been proposed, including gamma-secretase that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and yields amyloid beta peptide (A beta). Methods: We have proposed a neuroprotection mechanism for NSAIDs based on inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ overload. A beta oligomers promote Ca2+ influx and mitochondrial Cat' overload leading to neuron cell death. Several non-specific NSAIDs including ibuprofen, sulindac, indomethacin and R-flurbiprofen depolarize mitochondria in the low mu M range and prevent mitochondrial Ca2+ overload induced by A beta oligomers and/or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). However, at larger concentrations, NSAIDs may collapse mitochondrial potential (Delta Psi) leading to cell death. Results: Accordingly, this mechanism may explain neuroprotection at low concentrations and damage at larger doses, thus providing clues on the failure of promising trials. Perhaps lower NSAID concentrations and/or alternative compounds with larger dynamic ranges should be considered for future trials to provide definitive evidence of neuroprotection against AD.",

    "abstract": "Automatic situation understanding in videos has improved remarkably in recent years. However, state-of-the-art image processing methods still have considerable shortcomings: they usually require training data for each object class present and may have high false positive or false negative rates, making them impractical for general applications. We study a case that has a limited goal in a narrow context and argue about the complexity of the general problem. We suggest to solve this problem by including common sense rules and by exploiting various state-of-the art deep neural networks (DNNs) as the detectors of the conditions of those rules. We want to deal with the manipulation of unknown objects at a remote table. We have two action types to be detected: `picking up an object from the table' and `putting an object onto the table' and due to remote monitoring, we consider monocular observation. We quantitatively evaluate the performance of the system on manually annotated video segments, present precision and recall scores. We also discuss issues on machine reasoning. We conclude that the proposed neural-symbolic approach a) diminishes the required size of training data and b) enables new applications where labeled data are difficult or expensive to get.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models deployed in sensitive areas such as healthcare must be interpretable to ensure accountability and fairness. Rule lists (if Age < 35 ∧ Priors > 0 then Recidivism = True, else if Next Condition . . . ) offer full transparency, making them well-suited for high-stakes decisions. However, learning such rule lists presents significant challenges. Existing methods based on combinatorial optimization require feature pre-discretization and impose restrictions on rule size. Neuro-symbolic methods use more scalable continuous optimization yet place similar pre-discretization constraints and suffer from unstable optimization. To address the existing limitations, we introduce NeuRules, an end-to-end trainable model that unifies discretization, rule learning, and rule order into a single differentiable framework. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the rule list learning problem that converges to a strict rule list through temperature annealing. NeuRules learns both the discretizations of individual features, as well as their combination into conjunctive rules without any pre-processing or restrictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuRules consistently outperforms both combinatorial and neuro-symbolic methods, effectively learning simple and complex rules, as well as their order, across a wide range of datasets.",

    "abstract": "We have evaluated the usefulness of HBDT as an in vitro method for the diagnosis of drug allergy. Two hundred and thirty six patients with suspected drug sensitization to penicillin, streptomycin, sulfamides, pyrazolones and A.S.A. were analyzed. Seventy-nine of them were allergic; in 43 cases it was confirmed by in vivo methods. Other patients were diagnosed by clinical history only if they had more than two reactions to the same drug. In order to be included in this group patients with reactions to pyrazolones and A.S.A. had to have tolerated other NSAI, therefore these patients were allergic to one compound only. All patients were considered non-allergic were determined by a negative provocation test. In the group of allergic patients we obtained 63 (79%) positive degranulations and 16 (21%) negative. One hundred and thirty two (84%) negative degranulations and 25 (16%) positive were obtained in the group of non-allergic patients. Once having analyzed 10 statistical parameters with each drug, the HBOT appears to be a useful method for these drugs except for streptomycin. In 16 (80%) out of 20 aspirin sensitive asthmatic patients we found that their basophils were degranulated. In 7 patients with urticaria and/or angioedema by A.S.A. and other NSAI the degranulation was negative, confirming the absence of the involvement of basophils in this reactions.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Providing examples is one of the most common way for end-users to interact with program synthesizers. However, program synthesis systems assume that examples consistent with the program are chosen at random, and do not exploit the fact that users choose examples pragmatically. Prior work modeled program synthesis as pragmatic communication, but required an inefficient enumeration of the entire program space. In this paper, we show that it is possible to build a program synthesizer that is both pragmatic and efficient by approximating the joint distribution of programs with a product of independent factors, and performing pragmatic inference on each factor separately. This factored distribution approximates the exact joint distribution well when the examples are given pragmatically, and is compatible with a basic neuro-symbolic program synthesis algorithm. Surprisingly, we find that the synthesizer assuming a factored approximation performs better than a synthesizer assuming an exact joint distribution when evaluated on natural human inputs. This suggests that humans may be assuming a factored distribution while communicating programs.",

    "abstract": "In this research, a novel Neurosymbolic approach that seamlessly integrates the power of neural networks with the interpretability of symbolic AI to tackle complex problem domains. This pioneering algorithm not only outperforms traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models but also offers enhanced insights and understanding of the underlying data patterns. The comprehensive evaluation of our Neurosymbolic approach reveals lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) values and higher R-squared (R2) scores, signifying its superior ability to predict outcomes and explain the variance in output values. Notably, the model exhibits minimal discrepancies between training and validation performance, indicating its robust generalization capabilities to new, unseen data. The Neurosymbolic model achieves an R2 score of 0.9871 on the training dataset and 0.9762 on the validation dataset, while the Simple ANN model yields an R2 score of 0.9780 on the training dataset and 0.9759 on the validation dataset.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the relative contributions of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) types 1 and 2 to prostaglandin synthesis at term. Methods: Fetal membranes were collected from 6 pregnancies after elective caesarean section at term, prior to labour. The presence of COX-1 and COX-2 protein was determined using Western analysis. The relative contributions of the two isoforms of COX to prostaglandin synthesis were determined by incubation of fetal membrane discs with either a COX-2 selective inhibitor, SC236, or a COX-I selective inhibitor, SC560, and measurement of prostaglandin release during 24 h using enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Both COX-I and COX-2 protein were demonstrated in amnion and chorion-decidua. The COX-2 selective inhibitor, SC-236, significantly reduced prostaglandin synthesis, both in its COX-2 specific and higher, non-specific concentration ranges. The COX-1 selective inhibitor, SC-560, had no effect upon prostaglandin synthesis in its COX-I specific concentration range, but did significantly reduce prostaglandin synthesis at higher, non-selective concentrations. Conclusions: Fetal membranes contain both COX-1 and COX-2 at term, but only COX-2 contributes towards prostaglandin synthesis. COX-2 selective NSAI drugs will be as effective as non-selective agents in inhibition of fetal membrane prostaglandin synthesis and may represent a new strategy for tocolysis.

    "abstract": "Reaction prediction and retrosynthesis are the cornerstones of organic chemistry. Rule-based expert systems have been the most widespread approach to computationally solve these two related challenges to date. However, reaction rules often fail because they ignore the molecular context, which leads to reactivity conflicts. Herein, we report that deep neural networks can learn to resolve reactivity conflicts and to prioritize the most suitable transformation rules. We show that by training our model on 3.5 million reactions taken from the collective published knowledge of the entire discipline of chemistry, our model exhibits a top10-accuracy of 95 % in retrosynthesis and 97 % for reaction prediction on a validation set of almost 1 million reactions.",

We present RuleNN, a neural network architecture for learning transparent models for sentence classification. The models are in the form of rules expressed in first-order logic, a dialect with well-defined, human-understandable semantics. More precisely, RuleNN learns linguistic expressions (LE) built on top of predicates extracted using shallow natural language understanding. Our experimental results show that RuleNN outperforms statistical relational learning and other neuro-symbolic methods, and performs comparably with black-box recurrent neural networks. Our user studies confirm that the learned LEs are explainable and capture domain semantics. Moreover, allowing domain experts to modify LEs and instill more domain knowledge leads to human-machine co-creation of models with better performance.",

For this purpose, Nimesulide loaded PLGA nanoparticles modified with chitosan chloride were developed with solvent evaporation-diffusion-salting out method. Nanoparticle formulations were evaluated for production yield, process efficacy, particle size and polydispersity index (PDI), surface charge, morphologic properties, redispersibility index, residual PVA amount and in vitro dissolution rate profiles. The results obtained showed that surface modification with chitosan chloride was significantly effective statistically on the final properties of the nanoparticles. With this study, it was shown that PVA and chitosan chloride combined can play a key role in developing cationic and positively charged nanoparticles.",

In the present study, the irritation effects of mefenamic acid (MA), a prominent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drug, were evaluated on rat gastric and duodenal mucosa when suspended in 0.5% (w/v) sodiumcarboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) solution and loaded in alginate beads. Wistar albino rats weighing 200 +/- 50 g were used during in vivo animal studies. In this work, biodegradable controlled release MA beads and free MA were evaluated according to the degree of gastric or duodenal damage following oral administration in rats. The gastric and duodenal mucosa was examined for any haemorrhagic changes. Formulation code A10 showing both Case II transport and zero order drug release and t(50) % value of 5.22 h was chosen for in vivo animal studies. For in vivo trials, free MA (100 mgkg(-1)), blank and MA (100 mgkg(-1)) loaded alginate beads (formulation code A10) were suspended in 0.5% (w/v) NaCMC solution and each group was given to six rats orally by gavage.

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "LLMs' sources of knowledge are data snapshots containing factual information about entities collected at different timestamps and from different media types (e.g. wikis, social media, etc.). Such unstructured knowledge is subject to change due to updates through time from past to present. Equally important are the inconsistencies and inaccuracies occurring in different information sources. Consequently, the model's knowledge about an entity may be perturbed while training over the sequence of snapshots or at inference time, resulting in inconsistent and inaccurate model performance. In this work, we study the appropriateness of Large Language Models (LLMs) as repositories of factual knowledge. We consider twenty-four state-of-the-art LLMs that are either closed-, partially (weights), or fully (weight and training data) open-source. We evaluate their reliability in responding to time-sensitive factual questions in terms of accuracy and consistency when prompts are perturbed. We further evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods to improve LLMs' accuracy and consistency. We then propose ENtity-Aware Fine-tuning (ENAF), a soft neurosymbolic approach aimed at providing a structured representation of entities during fine-tuning to improve the model's performance.",

    "abstract": "The predicates used for Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems are usually elusive and need to be hand-crafted in advance, which limits the generalization of the system when learning new rules without sufficient background knowledge. Predicate Invention (PI) for ILP is the problem of discovering new concepts that describe hidden relationships in the domain. PI can mitigate the generalization problem for ILP by inferring new concepts, giving the system a better vocabulary to compose logic ruless. Although there are several PI approaches for symbolic ILP systems, PI for NeSy ILP systems that can handle visual input to learn logical rules using differentiable reasoning is relatively unaddressed. To this end, we propose a neural-symbolic approach, NeSy-pi, to invent predicates from visual scenes for NeSy ILP systems based on clustering and extension of relational concepts. (pi denotes the abbrivation of Predicate Invention). NeSy-pi processes visual scenes as input using deep neural networks for the visual perception and invents new concepts that support the task of classifying complex visual scenes. The invented concepts can be used by any NeSy ILP systems instead of hand-crafted background knowledge. Our experiments show that the PI model is capable of inventing high-level concepts and solving complex visual logic patterns more efficiently and accurately in the absence of explicit background knowledge. Moreover, the invented concepts are explainable and interpretable, while also providing competitive results with state-of-the-art NeSy ILP systems based on given knowledge.",

    "abstract": "We formulate a novel characterization of a family of invertible maps between two-dimensional domains. Our work follows two classic results: The Radó-Kneser-Choquet (RKC) theorem, which establishes the invertibility of harmonic maps into a convex planer domain; and Tutte's embedding theorem for planar graphs - RKC's discrete counterpart - which proves the invertibility of piecewise linear maps of triangulated domains satisfying a discrete-harmonic principle, into a convex planar polygon. In both theorems, the convexity of the target domain is essential for ensuring invertibility. We extend these characterizations, in both the continuous and discrete cases, by replacing convexity with a less restrictive condition. In the continuous case, Alessandrini and Nesi provide a characterization of invertible harmonic maps into non-convex domains with a smooth boundary by adding additional conditions on orientation preservation along the boundary. We extend their results by defining a condition on the normal derivatives along the boundary, which we call the cone condition; this condition is tractable and geometrically intuitive, encoding a weak notion of local invertibility. The cone condition enables us to extend Alessandrini and Nesi to the case of harmonic maps into non-convex domains with a piecewise-smooth boundary. In the discrete case, we use an analog of the cone condition to characterize invertible discrete-harmonic piecewise-linear maps of triangulations. This gives an analog of our continuous results and characterizes invertible discrete-harmonic maps in terms of the orientation of triangles incident on the boundary.",

    "abstract": "The advancement of intelligent systems, particularly in domains such as natural language processing and autonomous driving, has been primarily driven by deep neural networks (DNNs). However, these systems exhibit vulnerability to adversarial attacks that can be both subtle and imperceptible to humans, resulting in arbitrary and erroneous decisions. This susceptibility arises from the hierarchical layer-by-layer learning structure of DNNs, where small distortions can be exponentially amplified. While several defense methods have been proposed, they often necessitate prior knowledge of adversarial attacks to design specific defense strategies. This requirement is often unfeasible in real-world attack scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning model, termed “immune” learning, known as adversarial-resilient deep symbolic tree (ARDST), from a neurosymbolic perspective. The ARDST model is semiparametric and takes the form of a tree, with logic operators serving as nodes and learned parameters as weights of edges. This model provides a transparent reasoning path for decision-making, offering fine granularity, and has the capacity to withstand various types of adversarial attacks, all while maintaining a significantly smaller parameter space compared to DNNs. Our extensive experiments, conducted on three benchmark datasets, reveal that ARDST exhibits a representation learning capability similar to DNNs in perceptual tasks and demonstrates resilience against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies on adversarial attacks targeting self-driving policies fail to incorporate realistic-looking adversarial objects, limiting real-world applicability. Building upon prior research that facilitated the transition of adversarial objects from simulations to practical applications, this paper discusses a modified gradient-based texture optimization method to discover realistic-looking adversarial objects. While retaining the core architecture and techniques of the prior research, the proposed addition involves an entity termed the 'Judge'. This agent assesses the texture of a rendered object, assigning a probability score reflecting its realism. This score is integrated into the loss function to encourage the NeRF object renderer to concurrently learn realistic and adversarial textures. The paper analyzes four strategies for developing a robust 'Judge': 1) Leveraging cutting-edge vision-language models. 2) Fine-tuning open-sourced vision-language models. 3) Pretraining neurosymbolic systems. 4) Utilizing traditional image processing techniques. Our findings indicate that strategies 1) and 4) yield less reliable outcomes, pointing towards strategies 2) or 3) as more promising directions for future research.",

    "author": "Xu, Shengzhe and Thomas, Christo Kurisummoottil and Hashash, Omar and Muralidhar, Nikhil and Saad, Walid and Naren, Ramakrishnan",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) and foundation models have been recently touted as a game-changer for 6G systems. However, recent efforts on LLMs for wireless networks are limited to a direct application of existing language models that were designed for natural language processing (NLP) applications. To address this challenge and create wireless-centric foundation models, this paper presents a comprehensive vision on how to design universal foundation models that are tailored towards the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks. Diverging from NLP-based foundation models, the proposed framework promotes the design of large multi-modal models (LMMs) fostered by three key capabilities: 1) processing of multi-modal sensing data, 2) grounding of physical symbol representations in real-world wireless systems using causal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and 3) enabling instructibility from the wireless environment feedback to facilitate dynamic network adaptation thanks to logical and mathematical reasoning facilitated by neuro-symbolic AI. In essence, these properties enable the proposed LMM framework to build universal capabilities that cater to various cross-layer networking tasks and alignment of intents across different domains. Preliminary results from experimental evaluation demonstrate the efficacy of grounding using RAG in LMMs, and showcase the alignment of LMMs with wireless system designs. Furthermore, the enhanced rationale exhibited in the responses to mathematical questions by LMMs, compared to vanilla LLMs, demonstrates the logical and mathematical reasoning capabilities inherent in LMMs. Building on those results, we present a sequel of open questions and challenges for LMMs. We then conclude with a set of recommendations that ignite the path towards LMM-empowered AI-native systems.",

    "abstract": "Many question-answering problems can be approached as textual entailment tasks, where the hypotheses are formed by the question and candidate answers, and the premises are derived from an external knowledge base. However, current neural methods often lack transparency in their decision-making processes. Moreover, first-order logic methods, while systematic, struggle to integrate unstructured external knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework called Final, which combines FIrst-order logic with NAtural Logic for question answering. Our framework utilizes first-order logic to systematically decompose hypotheses and natural logic to construct reasoning paths from premises to hypotheses, employing bidirectional reasoning to establish links along the reasoning path. This approach not only enhances interpretability but also effectively integrates unstructured knowledge. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets, namely QASC, WorldTree, and WikiHop, demonstrate that Final outperforms existing methods in commonsense reasoning and reading comprehension tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Additionally, our framework also provides transparent reasoning paths that elucidate the rationale behind the correct decisions.",

    "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence has garnered considerable attention amid increasing industry demands for high-performance neural networks that are interpretable and adaptable to previously unknown problem domains with minimal reconfiguration. However, implementing neuro-symbolic hardware is challenging due to the complexity in symbolic knowledge representation and calculation. We experimentally demonstrated a memristor-based neuro-fuzzy hardware based on TiN/TaO(x)/HfO(x)/TiN chips that is superior to its silicon-based counterpart in terms of throughput and energy efficiency by using array topological structure for knowledge representation and physical laws for computing. Intrinsic memristor variability is fully exploited to increase robustness in knowledge representation. A hybrid in situ training strategy is proposed for error minimizing in training. The hardware adapts easier to a previously unknown environment, achieving 6.6 times faster convergence and 6 times lower error than deep learning. The hardware energy efficiency is over two orders of magnitude greater than field-programmable gate arrays. This research greatly extends the capability of memristor-based neuromorphic computing systems in artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "In knowledge graph completion, a symbolic reasoning method establishes a human readable rule by analyzing an imperfect knowledge graph and infers knowledge omitted by an inference engine. However, the entire rules cannot be defined based on a large-scale knowledge graph. This study proposes a method, based on a knowledge graph, that can facilitate end-to-end learning and induce rules without several processing steps that require direct human involvement. The proposed method combines the concept of unification used in symbolic reasoning and deep learning for training vectors expressing symbols. It trains the vectors expressing relations of rule schemas defined to induce rules based on a given knowledge graph. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated against neural theorem prover and the greedy neural theorem prover, which are recently developed neurosymbolic models, based on four benchmark datasets. The experimental results verify that the proposed method induces more significant rules in less training time. Furthermore, this study conducted an experiment on knowledge graph completion, implemented by an inference engine. Based on the experiment results, it was confirmed that the rules induced by the proposed model can indeed effectively complete missing knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in Smart Structures with very large scale embedded sensors and actuators have introduced new challenges in terms of data processing and sensor fusion. These smart structures are dynamically classified as a large-scale system with thousands of sensors and actuators that form the musculoskeletal of the structure, analogous to human body. In order to develop structural health monitoring and diagnostics with data provided by thousands of sensors, new sensor informatics has to be developed. The focus of our on-going research is to develop techniques and algorithms that would utilize this musculoskeletal system effectively; thus creating the intelligence for such a large-scale autonomous structure. To achieve this level of intelligence, three major research tasks are being conducted: development of a Bio-Inspired data analysis and information extraction from thousands of sensors; development of an analytical technique for Optimal Sensory System using Structural Observability; and creation of a bio-inspired decision-making and control system. This paper is focused on the results of our effort on the first task, namely development of a Neuro-Morphic Engineering approach, using a neuro-symbolic data manipulation, inspired by the understanding of human information processing architecture, for sensor fusion and structural diagnostics.",

FUELCON proposes sets of alternative configurations of allocation of fuel assemblies that are each positioned in the planar grid of a horizontal section of a reactor core. Results are simulated, and an expert user can also use FUELCON to revise rulesets and improve on his or her heuristics. The successful completion of FUELCON led this research team into undertaking a panoply of sequel projects, of which we provide a meta-architectural comparative formal discussion. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel adaptive technique that learns the optimal allocation heuristic for the various cores. The algorithm is a hybrid of a fine-grained neural network and symbolic computation components. This hybrid architecture is sensitive enough to learn the particular characteristics of the `in-core fuel management problem' at hand, and is powerful enough to use this information fully to automatically revise heuristics, thus improving upon those provided by a human expert.

Recent progress with a hybrid neural/symbolic cognitive model of problem-solving [ 9] prompted us to investigate the adequacy of these columns for the construction of purely neural cognitive models. Here we examine the computational power of networks of columns and show that every Turing machine maps in a straightforward fashion onto such a network. Furthermore, several hierarchical structures composed of columns that are critical in this mapping promise to provide biologically plausible models of timing circuits, gating mechanisms, activation-based short-term memory, and simple if-then rules that will likely be necessary in neural models of higher cognition.",

We evaluate Revilio on a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing table parsing methods.

    "author": "Sioutis, Michael",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "We discuss a research roadmap for going beyond the state of the art in qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning (QSTR). Simply put, QSTR is a major field of study in Artificial Intelligence that abstracts from numerical quantities of space and time by using qualitative descriptions instead (e.g., precedes, contains, is left of); thus, it provides a concise framework that allows for rather inexpensive reasoning about entities located in space or time. Applications of QSTR can be found in a plethora of areas and domains such as smart environments, intelligent vehicles, and unmanned aircraft systems. Our discussion involves researching novel local consistencies in the aforementioned discipline, defining dynamic algorithms pertaining to these consistencies that can allow for efficient reasoning over changing spatio-temporal information, and leveraging the structures of the locally consistent related problems with regard to novel decomposability and theoretical tractability properties. Ultimately, we argue for pushing the envelope in QSTR via defining tools for tackling dynamic variants of the fundamental reasoning problems in this discipline, i.e., problems stated in terms of changing input data. Indeed, time is a continuous flow and spatial objects can change (e.g., in shape, size, or structure) as time passes; therefore, it is pertinent to be able to efficiently reason about dynamic spatio-temporal data. Finally, these tools are to be integrated into the larger context of highly active areas such as neuro-symbolic learning and reasoning, planning, data mining, and robotic applications. Our final goal is to inspire further discussion in the community about constraint-based QSTR in general, and the possible lines of future research that we outline here in particular.",

    "author": "Sioutis, Michael and Zhiguo, Long",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning, or QSTR for short, is a major research area in AI that deals with the fundamental cognitive concepts of space and time in an abstract, human-like manner. For instance, in natural language one uses expressions such as ``Region X is located inside or north of Region Y '' or ``Task A is scheduled after or during Task B '' to spatially or temporally relate one object with another object or oneself, without resorting to providing quantitative information about these entities. In brief, QSTR simplifies complex mathematical theories that revolve around spatial and temporal entities to manageable qualitative constraint languages (calculi), which can in turn give rise to interpretable spatio-temporal representations. Thus, QSTR forms a concise and explainable paradigm for dealing with entities pertaining to space and time, with the potential to boost research in a plethora of domains that can range anywhere from theoretical computer science and logic to practical algorithms and applications. In this tutorial, we take a twofold approach to introducing our audience to the rich research area of Qualitative Spatial and Temporal Reasoning. First, we present the scientific background in detail, mentioning some terminology, key definitions, and problems associated with the field, and follow up with a presentation of the state-of-the-art frameworks that exist for handling QSTR data, focusing on native methods and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and Answer Set Programming (ASP) approaches. Secondly, and most importantly, we address the gap that exists between QSTR-a symbolic paradigm-and Machine Learning, and bring forward some successful examples of neuro-symbolic integration in the context of spatio-temporal information from the recent literature; we argue for further pursuing this promising research direction and explain the current challenges that need to be overcome for obtaining hybrid AI systems that can be applied to highly active areas such as planning, data mining, and robotic applications.",

    "abstract": "Resolving the dichotomy between the human-like yet constrained reasoning processes of Cognitive Architectures and the broad but often noisy inference behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a challenging but exciting pursuit, for enabling reliable machine reasoning capabilities in production systems. Because Cognitive Architectures are famously developed for the purpose of modeling the internal mechanisms of human cognitive decision-making at a computational level, new investigations consider the goal of informing LLMs with the knowledge necessary for replicating such processes, e.g., guided perception, memory, goal-setting, and action. Previous approaches that use LLMs for grounded decision-making struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require slower, deliberate cognition over fast and intuitive inference - reporting issues related to the lack of sufficient grounding, as in hallucination. To resolve these challenges, we introduce LLM-ACTR, a novel neuro-symbolic architecture that provides human-aligned and versatile decision-making by integrating the ACT-R Cognitive Architecture with LLMs. Our framework extracts and embeds knowledge of ACT-R's internal decision-making process as latent neural representations, injects this information into trainable LLM adapter layers, and fine-tunes the LLMs for downstream prediction. Our experiments on novel Design for Manufacturing tasks show both improved task performance as well as improved grounded decision-making capability of our approach, compared to LLM-only baselines that leverage chain-of-thought reasoning strategies.",

    "author": "Škrlj, B. and Martinc, M. and Lavrač, N. and Pollak, S.",

    "abstract": "Learning from texts has been widely adopted throughout industry and science. While state-of-the-art neural language models have shown very promising results for text classification, they are expensive to (pre-)train, require large amounts of data and tuning of hundreds of millions or more parameters. This paper explores how automatically evolved text representations can serve as a basis for explainable, low-resource branch of models with competitive performance that are subject to automated hyperparameter tuning. We present autoBOT (automatic Bags-Of-Tokens), an autoML approach suitable for low resource learning scenarios, where both the hardware and the amount of data required for training are limited. The proposed approach consists of an evolutionary algorithm that jointly optimizes various sparse representations of a given text (including word, subword, POS tag, keyword-based, knowledge graph-based and relational features) and two types of document embeddings (non-sparse representations). The key idea of autoBOT is that, instead of evolving at the learner level, evolution is conducted at the representation level. The proposed method offers competitive classification performance on fourteen real-world classification tasks when compared against a competitive autoML approach that evolves ensemble models, as well as state-of-the-art neural language models such as BERT and RoBERTa. Moreover, the approach is explainable, as the importance of the parts of the input space is part of the final solution yielded by the proposed optimization procedure, offering potential for meta-transfer learning.",

Whether this benefit in advanced breast cancer extends to early breast cancer is unclear. METHODS: In this international, open-label, randomized, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive ribociclib (at a dose of 400 mg per day for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off, for 3 years) plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI; letrozole at a dose of 2.5 mg per day or anastrozole at a dose of 1 mg per day for ≥5 years) or an NSAI alone. Premenopausal women and men also received goserelin every 28 days. Eligible patients had anatomical stage II or III breast cancer. Here we report the results of a prespecified interim analysis of invasive disease-free survival, the primary end point; other efficacy and safety results are also reported. Invasive disease-free survival was evaluated with the use of the Kaplan-Meier method. The statistical comparison was made with the use of a stratified log-rank test, with a protocol-specified stopping boundary of a one-sided P-value threshold of 0.0128 for superior efficacy. RESULTS: As of the data-cutoff date for this prespecified interim analysis (January 11, 2023), a total of 426 patients had had invasive disease, recurrence, or death. A significant invasive disease-free survival benefit was seen with ribociclib plus an NSAI as compared with an NSAI alone. At 3 years, invasive disease-free survival was 90.4% with ribociclib plus an NSAI and 87.1% with an NSAI alone (hazard ratio for invasive disease, recurrence, or death, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.91; P = 0.003). Secondary end points - distant disease-free survival and recurrence-free survival - also favored ribociclib plus an NSAI. The 3-year regimen of ribociclib at a 400-mg starting dose plus an NSAI was not associated with any new safety signals. CONCLUSIONS: Ribociclib plus an NSAI significantly improved invasive disease-free survival among patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative stage II or III early breast cancer.

    "abstract": "As part of the ongoing BIPM key comparison BIPM.EM-K11.b, a comparison of the 10 V voltage reference standards of the BIPM and the National Standards Authority of Ireland National Metrology Laboratory (NSAI - NML), Dublin, Ireland, was carried out in May and June 2018. Two BIPM Zener diode-based travelling standards (Fluke 732B), BIPM \\\\_E (ZE) and BIPM F (ZF), were transported by freight to NSAI-NML. At NSAI-NML, the reference standard for DC voltage at the 10 V level consists of a group of characterized Zener diode-based electronic voltage standards. The output ElVIF (Electromotive Force) of each travelling standard was measured by direct comparison with the group standard. At the BIPM the travelling standards were calibrated, before and after the measurements at NSAI-NML, with the Josephson Voltage Standard. Results of all measurements were corrected for the dependence of the output voltages of the Zener standards on internal temperature and ambient atmospheric pressure. The final result of the comparison is presented as the difference between the value assigned to DC voltage standard by NSAI-NML, at the level of 10 V, at NSAI-NML, U-NML, and that assigned by the BIPM, at the BIPM, U-BIPM, at the reference dates of 20 May 2018. U-NML - U-BIPM = - 1.21 mu V, u(e) = 1.38 mu V, at 10 V where ue is the combined standard uncertainty associated with the measured difference, including the uncertainty of the representation of the volt at the BIPM, at NSAI-NML, and the uncertainty related to the comparison. The comparison result is within the claimed uncertainties despite the fact that one of the NSAI NML results (for standard ZF) differed from the BIPM value by-1.66 mu V. The voltage standards maintained by NSAI-NML and the BIPM were equivalent, within their stated standard uncertainties, on the mean date of the comparison.",

The integration of neural-symbolic can offer better learning and reasoning while providing a means for interpretability through the representation of symbolic knowledge. Although previous works focus intensively on supervised feedforward neural networks, little has been done for the unsupervised counterparts. In this paper we show how to integrate symbolic knowledge into unsupervised neural networks. We exemplify our approach with knowledge in different forms, including propositional logic for DNA promoter prediction and first-order logic for understanding family relationship.",

    "abstract": "The idea of representing symbolic knowledge in connectionist systems has been a long-standing endeavour which has attracted much attention recently with the objective of combining machine learning and scalable sound reasoning. Early work has shown a correspondence between propositional logic and symmetrical neural networks which nevertheless did not scale well with the number of variables and whose training regime was inefficient. In this paper, we introduce Logical Boltzmann Machines (LBM), a neurosymbolic system that can represent any propositional logic formula in strict disjunctive normal form. We prove equivalence between energy minimization in LBM and logical satisfiability thus showing that LBM is capable of sound reasoning. We evaluate reasoning empirically to show that LBM is capable of finding all satisfying assignments of a class of logical formulae by searching fewer than 0.75% of the possible (approximately 1 billion) assignments. We compare learning in LBM with a symbolic inductive logic programming system, a state-of-the-art neurosymbolic system and a purely neural network-based system, achieving better learning performance in five out of seven data sets.",

Various strategies, models, architectures and classification schemes have been suggested for neuro-symbolic integration. The vast majority of applications however, fall in modular hybrid systems. So far, mainly three types of coupling mechanisms: (1) passive coupling (2) active coupling, and (3) interleaved coupling, have been suggested and practiced to develop modular hybrid systems. In this paper, we suggest a new framework that uses database coupling mechanism for neuro-symbolic integration to develop modular hybrid systems. We demonstrate how this database coupling approach can be used to integrate modules in different configurations or integration modes.",

The zoom-FFT and interpolation are employed to complement each other by the new estimator of NSAI to improve the precision of frequency estimation and immunity in noise. The simulation results indicate that NSAI not only has an estimation precision of approach CRB(Cramer-Rao lower bound) under the condition of low SNR, but also has a good stability in all frequency domains. The new estimator of NSAI needs only once FFT and two points DFT, therefore it can be achieved in real-time.",

On the deep convergence of computing and communication, networking systems of AI (NSAI) is presenting a paradigm shift, where distributed AI becomes immersive in all elements of the network, i.e., cloud, edge, and terminal devices, which make AI virtually operating as a networking system. On the other hand, by the evolution of the communication systems, a network is becoming a service-specific system interweaved with AI, i.e., the network operates as an AI system, enabling real-time smart services. With the developing technology trends of ``AI as a network and network as an AI, '' the ecosystem of NSAI can be presenting the next-generation waves of both AI systems and B5G-6G communication networks. In this article, we mainly aim to provide a comprehensive survey on the system architecture, key technologies, application scenarios, challenges, and opportunities of NSAI, which can shed light on the future developments of both telecommunications and AI computing. The contributions of this article also include: 1) providing a unified framework for the deep convergence of computing and communications, where the network and application/service can be jointly optimized as a single integrated system and 2) suggesting the roadmap and open research problems in realizing the online-evolutive integration of cyberspace, physical world, and human society, toward the ubiquitous brain networks (UBNs), which are requiring the joint efforts from both research communities of computing and communication.",

This paper introduces CNGCI (Conflict-driven Narrative Generation through Commonsense Inference), a neurosymbolic framework designed to generate coherent stories embedded with conflict using commonsense inference. Our framework defines narrative conflict by leveraging the concept of a soft causal threat, where conflict serves as an obstacle that reduces the likelihood of achieving the protagonist's goal by weakening the causal link between context and goal through defeasible inference. Comparative studies against multiple story generation baselines utilizing commonsense reasoning show that our framework outperforms the baselines in creating narratives that distinctly embody conflict while maintaining coherency.",

    "abstract": "The challenge of hybrid learning systems is to use the information provided by one source of information to compensate information missing from the other source. The neuro-symbolic combination represents a promising research way. The synergy between the symbolic (theoretical) and neural (empirical) approaches makes their combination more effective than each of them used alone. In this article, we describe an Arabic literal amount recognition system that uses a neuro-symbolic classifier. For this purpose, we first extract structural features from the words contained in the amounts vocabulary. Then, we build a symbolic knowledge base that reflects a classification of words according to their features. In a third step, we use a translation algorithm (from rules to neural network) to determine the neural network architecture and to initialize its connections with specific values rather than random values, as is the case in classical neural networks. This construction approach provides the network with theoretical knowledge and reduces the training stage, which remains necessary because of styles and writing conditions variability. After this empirical training stage using real examples, the network acquires a final topology, which allows it to recognize new handwritten amounts.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based object tracking is a critical component for achieving autonomous aerial navigation, particularly for obstacle avoidance. Neuromorphic Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) or event cameras, inspired by biological vision, offer a promising alternative to conventional frame-based cameras. These cameras can detect changes in intensity asynchronously, even in challenging lighting conditions, with a high dynamic range and resistance to motion blur. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are increasingly used to process these event-based signals efficiently and asynchronously. Meanwhile, physics-based artificial intelligence (AI) provides a means to incorporate system-level knowledge into neural networks via physical modeling. This enhances robustness, energy efficiency, and provides symbolic explainability. In this work, we present a neuromorphic navigation framework for autonomous drone navigation. The focus is on detecting and navigating through moving gates while avoiding collisions. We use event cameras for detecting moving objects through a shallow SNN architecture in an unsupervised manner. This is combined with a lightweight energy-aware physics-guided neural network (PgNN) trained with depth inputs to predict optimal flight times, generating near-minimum energy paths. The system is implemented in the Gazebo simulator and integrates a sensor-fused vision-to-planning neuro-symbolic framework built with the Robot Operating System (ROS) middleware. This work highlights the future potential of integrating event-based vision with physics-guided planning for energy-efficient autonomous navigation, particularly for low-latency decision-making.",

    "author": "Souza, Paulo Vitor de Campos and Gianluca, Apriceno and Mauro, Dragoni",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "This paper enhances Logic Tensor Networks through the integration of uninorm based fuzzy operators. Uninorms, a class of operators that bridge the gap between t-norms and t-conorms, offer unparalleled flexibility and adaptability, making them ideal for modeling the complex, often ambiguous relationships inherent in real-world data. By embedding these operators into Logic Tensor Networks, we present a methodology that significantly increases the network's capability to handle nuanced logical operations, thereby improving its applicability across different domains. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of uninorm based operators in enhancing the precision of Logic Tensor Networks. Our findings suggest that the inclusion of uninorms not only broadens the scope of problems that Logic Tensor Networks can address but also deepens their reasoning capabilities, paving the way for more sophisticated artificial intelligence systems. This work lays a foundational stone for future research in the intersection of fuzzy logic and neural-symbolic computing, suggesting directions for further exploration and integration of fuzzy systems elements into Logic Tensor Networks.GitHub: https://github.com/IDA-FBK/UniLTN",

    "abstract": "Firstly, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of various treatment modalities using ultrasonography (US), and secondly, we aimed to assess the correlations between the ultrasonographic findings and electrophysiological tests, symptom severity, functional status and physical findings. 74 hands of 47 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were randomly treated by applying wrist splinting alone in the neutral position (23 hands), phonophoresis with corticosteroid (PCS) (28 hands) and phonophoresis with non-steroid anti-inflamatory drug (PNSAI) (23 hands). The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve (MN) was determined by ultrasound on the initial and at the 3 months after treatment. MN conduction studies were performed on the initial visit and 3 months after treatment. The patients completed the Boston symptom severity questionnaire. For clinical evaluation, we used Phalen's and Tinel's signs. We could find reduction in CSA of MN in PCS group (P < 0.001). The CSA of MN was inversely correlated with motor sensory and median nerve conduction velocity (NCV) (r = 0.421, r = 0.213, respectively). Statistically significant correlations were not detected between ultrasonographic parameters and clinical evaluation parameters (P > 0.05) and also between ultrasonographic parameters and BQ scores (P > 0.05). Although there was some improvement in clinical parameters, ultrasonographic parameters did not change in P-NSAI group. CONCLUSION: The most effective treatment modality was P-CS according to ultrasonographic and other findings. Although there were inverse correlations between the CSA of MN and sensory and motor MN conduction velocity, no relationship was found between symptom severity, functional status and US findings or electrophysiological studies.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the role of Neuro-Symbolic (NS) methods within the standard Observe, Orient, Decide and Act (OODA) framework and discuss their associated opportunities and challenges. To ground the discussion, we consider the OODA loop applied to a wildland firefighting use case where mixed teams of autonomous agents and humans need to collaboratively work to contain and ultimately extinguish large-scale fires. NS methods are appealing as they enable the integration of symbolic knowledge coming, for example, from time-tested firefighting tactics and procedures encoded in training manuals. However, there are key challenges in capturing and integrating such information within NS pipelines, especially in a way that is scalable with respect to the number of procedures, dynamics of the environment, and regulations. The integration of such symbolic priors within a NS OODA loop will enable autonomous systems to generate highly expressive yet compressed representations (or abstractions) of the environment and other agents' state, actions, and intent. However, NS integration brings new challenges, such as, designing abstractions that are composable and transferable across complex tasks, deciding how to ground symbols to sensory data, and verifying their validity to ensure they lead to safe decisions. Symbolic abstractions also need to deal with the fact that sensory data is uncertain-like the behavior of the fire front (boundary, rate of spread, etc.). Furthermore, prior knowledge may be incomplete and inconsistent leading to representations that need to be capable of explicitly modelling and managing ambiguity. Addressing such challenge problems will not only advance the state-of-the-art in NS AI, but also concretely demonstrate the benefits of such methods within the autonomy domain.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The MONALEESA-7 trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of ribociclib plus a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) [with goserelin] for pre-/perimenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative advanced breast cancer. This analysis evaluated the cost effectiveness of ribociclib plus NSAI vs NSAI monotherapy and tamoxifen monotherapy from the perspective of the Canadian healthcare system. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for ribociclib plus an NSAI vs an NSAI and vs tamoxifen was estimated using a semi-Markov cohort model developed in Microsoft Excel with a 15-year time horizon and states for progression-free survival, post-progression survival, and dead. Survival distributions for progression-free survival, post-progression survival, and time to discontinuation as well as health-state utilities were estimated using data from MONALEESA-7. Direct costs of advanced breast cancer treatment were based on Canadian-specific values from published sources. Costs (CAN 2019) and QALYs were discounted at 1.5% annually. RESULTS: Ribociclib plus an NSAI was estimated to yield gains of 1.42 life-years and 1.17 QALYs vs an NSAI, and 2.61 life-years and 2.12 QALYs vs tamoxifen, at incremental costs of 209,701 and 220,836, respectively. In probabilistic analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ribociclib plus an NSAI was estimated to be 178,872 per QALY gained vs an NSAI and 104,400 per QALY gained vs tamoxifen. Results of deterministic analyses were similar (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 177,245 and 103,316 vs NSAI and tamoxifen, respectively). Results were sensitive to parametric distributions used for projecting progression-free survival and the time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: At its current list price, ribociclib used in combination with NSAI is likely to be co-effective relative to an NSAI alone or tamoxifen alone if the willingness-to-pay threshold is less than approximately 178,000 per QALY. These results have informed deliberations regarding reimbursement and access to this treatment in Canada and may be useful for decision makers in other settings.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: Past research suggests that patients with advanced breast cancer prefer treatments with improved clinical outcomes and lower risk of side effects. Evidence on preferences of Canadian patients and physicians for treatments for advanced breast cancer is limited. (2) Methods: Patients' and physicians' preferences for treatments for HR+/HER2-, pre-/peri-menopausal advanced breast cancer were assessed by an online discrete choice experiment (DCE). Treatment alternatives were characterized by seven attributes regarding dosing, efficacy, and toxicities, with levels corresponding to those for ribociclib plus a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI), NSAI, and tamoxifen. For patients, impacts of advanced breast cancer on quality of life (QOL) and ability to work/perform activities of daily living also were assessed. Patients were recruited by a Canadian breast cancer patient advocacy group through email and social media. Physicians were recruited by email. (3) Results: Among 118 patients starting the survey, 23 completed ≥ 1 DCE question (19%). Among 271 physicians who were sent the e-mail invitation, 21 completed ≥ 1 DCE question (8%). For both patients and physicians, the increased probability of remaining alive and without cancer progression over 2 years was the most important attribute. A treatment with attributes consistent with ribociclib plus NSAI was chosen by patients and physicians in 70% and 88% of the time, respectively. A substantial proportion of patients reported worrying about future diagnostic tests and their cancer getting worse; (4) Conclusions: Canadian patients and physicians are generally concordant in preference for advanced breast cancer treatments, preferring ribociclib plus NSAI to other options.",

    "abstract": "The characteristics of health information and its flow throughout health and social care delivery and research is integral to quality integrated care. Electronic Health Record(EHR) systems can facilitate appropriate availability of quality, clinically sensible information to decision makers when and where required. Development of EHRs is very challenging due to the heterogeneity of information producers and consumers, the care, research, regulation and development environment and the range of current and future uses and use contexts for the record. There is also the complexity of the system itself to consider. EHRs are longitidinal and comprise many interdependent aspects e.g. architecture, data storage and user interfaces to suit use settings within care and research organisations as well as home or community environments.Traditionally, patients have not been included in the development of such large scale, complex, national eHealth systems even though they and their carers are in a unique position to describe and comment on the characteristics of information flow across the entire system. In Ireland, the Office of the Chief Information Officer(OOCIO) has placed significant focus on our national EHR development. Some new groupings e.g. the council of clinical information officers (CCIO) have formed and relationships between existing stakeholders and patients are developing and strengthening. One of the more innovative, patient inclusive activities of the OOCIO involves development of personas that will be representative of potential users of our national EHR and will directly influence procurement of our national EHR.The development process for EHR systems is complex with unstable user requirements, a variety of independent stakeholder groupings, interdependent components, essential flexibility and reliance on human skills and teamwork. These characteristics place EHRs squarely in the domain of what are called wicked systems(1). One crucial factor in successful development and adoption of wicked systems is stakeholder engagement with multiple engagement processes required, usually over a long period of time. Due to lengthy project timescales, support and resources it is not usually possible to get consistent, continual stakeholder engagement for the duration of development of a national EHR. So, care needs to be taken on engagement processes, opportunities and outputs.The authors are collaborating with various stakeholders including the national standards authority of Ireland (NSAI), the health informatics society of Ireland(HISI), regulation authorities, the OOCIO, the CCIO, Higher education institutes, industry, patients and patient organisations. This paper will report on three aspects of this collaboration. Firstly, describing our national EHR development environment. Secondly, identifying how patients and their carers could potentially engage meaningfully alongside other stakeholders in the development and adoption of our National EHR. Finally, engagement work to date will be presented including patient persona development with the OOCIO, engagment with NSAI/HSE advisory panel to comment on information standards aspects for our national EHR, a patient focused workshop and feedback session at the HISI annual conference which captured views on and possible next steps for our national EHR development and on the educational front, inclusion of patients in participatory design classes on the MSc in Health Informatics in Trinity College Dublin.References:1- Henver A, March S, Park J.

    "abstract": "The emergence of neuro-symbolic A.I. (NSAI) workloads introduces a new and powerful approach to artificial intelligence by combining deep learning techniques with traditional rules-based approaches. Dedicated research to better understand and enhance these NSAI models is needed as they are emerging as a major field in AI. Examples of NSAI models analyzed in this paper are the Neural Logic Machine (NLM) and the Logic Tensor Network (LTN). Given that neuro-symbolic models are still an evolving research area, the performance characteristics remain insufficiently understood. Conducting an analysis of the performance characteristics of NSAI workloads offers valuable insights into potential avenues for accelerating and enhancing the performance of these models. By examining the microarchitecture performance characteristics of the NSAI models, including compute workload, memory workload, schedule statistics, warp state statistics, and executed instruction mix, a deeper understanding of the internal mechanisms of these NSAI models can be gained. The obtained performance characteristics have the potential to facilitate improvements in LI and L2 cache hit rates, issue latency, execution latency, IMC and scoreboard stalls, and other microarchitecture opportunities. In this paper, we explore the promising acceleration design opportunities of the NLM and LTN through the analysis of their microarchitecture performance and characterization.",

    "abstract": "Neural-symbolic models provide a powerful tool to tackle complex visual reasoning tasks by combining symbolic program execution for reasoning and deep representation learning for visual recognition. A probabilistic formulation of such models with stochastic latent variables can obtain an interpretable and legible reasoning system with less supervision. However, it is still nontrivial to generate reasonable symbolic structures without the guidance of domain knowledge, since it generally involves an optimization problem with both continuous and discrete variables. Despite the challenges, the interpretability of such symbolic structures provides an interface to regularize their generation by domain knowledge. In this article, we propose to incorporate the available domain knowledge into the learning process of probabilistic neural-symbolic (PNS) models via posterior constraints that directly regularize the structure posterior. In this way, our model is able to identify a middle point where the structure generation process mainly learns from data but also selectively borrows information from domain knowledge. We further present inductive reasoning where the posterior constraints can be automatically reweighted to handle noisy annotations. The experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on major abstract reasoning datasets and enjoys good generalization capability and data efficiency.",

We posit that developing high-level visual sensemaking capabilities requires a systematic, tight yet modular integration of (neural) visual processing techniques with high-level commonsense knowledge representation and reasoning methods pertaining to space, motion, actions, events, conceptual knowledge etc. As an exemplar of this thinking, we position recent work on deeply semantic, explainable, neurosymbolic visuospatial reasoning driven by an integration of methods in ( deep learning based) vision and (KR based) semantics. The positioned work is general, but its significance is demonstrated and empirically benchmarked in the context of (active, realtime) visual sensemaking for self-driving vehicles.",

    "abstract": "The entorhinal-hippocampal formation is the mammalian brain's navigation system, encoding both physical and abstract spaces via grid cells. This system is well-studied in neuroscience, and its efficiency and versatility make it attractive for applications in robotics and machine learning. While continuous attractor networks (CANs) successfully model entorhinal grid cells for encoding physical space, integrating both continuous spatial and abstract spatial computations into a unified framework remains challenging. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by proposing a mechanistic model for versatile information processing in the entorhinal-hippocampal formation inspired by CANs and Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), a neuro-symbolic computing framework. The novel grid-cell VSA (GC-VSA) model employs a spatially structured encoding scheme with 3D neuronal modules mimicking the discrete scales and orientations of grid cell modules, reproducing their characteristic hexagonal receptive fields. In experiments, the model demonstrates versatility in spatial and abstract tasks: (1) accurate path integration for tracking locations, (2) spatio-temporal representation for querying object locations and temporal relations, and (3) symbolic reasoning using family trees as a structured test case for hierarchical relationships.",

    "abstract": "O-RAN specifications reshape RANs with function disaggregation and open interfaces, driven by RAN Intelligent Controllers. This enables data-driven management through AI/ML but poses trust challenges due to human operators' limited understanding of AI/ML decision-making. Balancing resource provisioning and avoiding overprovisioning and underprovisioning is critical, especially among the multiple virtualized base station(vBS) instances. Thus, we propose a novel Federated Machine Reasoning (FLMR) framework, a neurosymbolic method for federated reasoning, learning, and querying. FLMR optimizes CPU demand prediction based on contextual information and vBS configuration using local monitoring data from virtual base stations (vBS) on a shared O-Cloud platform.This optimization is critical, as insufficient computing resources can result in synchronization loss and significantly reduce network throughput. In the telecom domain, particularly in the virtual Radio Access Network (vRAN) sector, predicting and managing the CPU load of vBSs poses a significant challenge for network operators. Our proposed FLMR framework ensures transparency and human understanding in AI/ML decisions and addresses the evolving demands of the 6G O-RAN landscape, where reliability and performance are paramount. Furthermore, we performed a comparative analysis using 𝐷eepCog as the baseline method. The outcomes highlight how our proposed approach outperforms the baseline and strikes a better balance between resource overprovisioning and underprovisioning. Our method notably lowers both provisioning relative to the baseline by a factor of 6.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have made significant advances in natural language inference (NLI) tasks, however their sensitivity to textual perturbations and dependence on large datasets indicate an over-reliance on shallow heuristics. In contrast, inductive logic programming (ILP) excels at inferring logical relationships across diverse, sparse and limited datasets, but its discrete nature requires the inputs to be precisely specified, which limits their application. This paper proposes a bridge between the two approaches: neuro-symbolic contrastive learning. This allows for smooth and differentiable optimisation that improves logical accuracy across an otherwise discrete, noisy, and sparse topological space of logical functions. We show that abstract logical relationships can be effectively embedded within a neuro-symbolic paradigm, by representing data as logic programs and sets of logic rules. The embedding space captures highly varied textual information with similar semantic logical relations, but can also separate similar textual relations that have dissimilar logical relations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the inference capabilities of the models in terms of generalisation and reasoning.",

Clinical effect in the form of a decrease of both the intensivity of algesic syndrome and autonomic manifestations as well as improvement of night sleep were clearly seen in group 1. Manifestations of both anxious and depressive disorders were less pronounced. Treatment by Nurofen resulted in slight decrease of intensivity of pains but didn't lead to pronounced alterations of emotional sphere. Administration of either Lerivon or Nurofen promoted the increase of pain thresholds (according to the data of nociceptive flexory reflex). The data obtained testified the necessity of complex therapy of FM patients including administration of antidepressants and analgetic drugs of NSAI group. Dynamic polysomnographic examination of patients from group 3 revealed the increase of total sleep duration, decrease of the time of falling asleep, the latent period of the phase of the fast sleep, activated mouvement index, intensivity of movements and the time of being awake in the sleep.

    "abstract": "Humans have the remarkable ability to recognize and acquire novel visual concepts in a zero-shot manner. Given a high-level, symbolic description of a novel concept in terms of previously learned visual concepts and their relations, humans can recognize novel concepts without seeing any examples. Moreover, they can acquire new concepts by parsing and communicating symbolic structures using learned visual concepts and relations. Endowing these capabilities in machines is pivotal in improving their generalization capability at inference time. In this work, we introduce Zero-shot Concept Recognition and Acquisition (ZeroC), a neuro-symbolic architecture that can recognize and acquire novel concepts in a zero-shot way. ZeroC represents concepts as graphs of constituent concept models (as nodes) and their relations (as edges). To allow inference time composition, we employ energy-based models (EBMs) to model concepts and relations. We design ZeroC architecture so that it allows a one-to-one mapping between a symbolic graph structure of a concept and its corresponding EBM, which for the first time, allows acquiring new concepts, communicating its graph structure, and applying it to classification and detection tasks (even across domains) at inference time. We introduce algorithms for learning and inference with ZeroC. We evaluate ZeroC on a challenging grid-world dataset which is designed to probe zero-shot concept recognition and acquisition, and demonstrate its capability.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This was a Japanese subpopulation analysis of MONARCH 3, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study of abemaciclib plus nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAIs) for initial therapy for advanced breast cancer (ABC). METHODS: Eligibility included postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative ABC who had no prior systemic therapy in the advanced disease setting. Patients (N = 493) were randomized 2:1 to receive abemaciclib or placebo (150 mg) plus either 1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole (physician's choice). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). RESULTS: In Japan, 53 patients were randomized (abemaciclib, n = 38; placebo, n = 15). At final PFS analysis (November 3, 2017), median PFS was 29.1 and 14.9 months in the abemaciclib and placebo groups, respectively (hazard ratio 0.537; 95% confidence interval 0.224-1.289). ORR in measurable disease was 62.1 and 50.0% in the abemaciclib and placebo groups, respectively. The Japanese PK profile was comparable to that of the overall population. Consistent with prior studies, the most frequent adverse events reported were diarrhea (abemaciclib: any grade, 94.7%; grade ≥ 3, 10.5%; placebo: any grade, 46.7%; grade ≥ 3, 0%) and neutropenia (abemaciclib: any grade, 68.4%; grade ≥ 3, 21.1%; placebo: any grade, 0%). HRQoL outcomes were generally similar between treatments except for the diarrhea score, which favored placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with findings in the overall population, abemaciclib plus NSAI was an effective initial treatment in the Japanese subpopulation, with a manageable safety profile.

    "abstract": "Neural finite-state transducers (NFSTs) form an expressive family of neurosymbolic sequence transduction models. An NFST models each string pair as having been generated by a latent path in a finite-state transducer. As they are deep generative models, both training and inference of NFSTs require inference networks that approximate posterior distributions over such latent variables. In this paper, we focus on the resulting challenge of imputing the latent alignment path that explains a given pair of input and output strings (e.g., during training). We train three autoregressive approximate models for amortized inference of the path, which can then be used as proposal distributions for importance sampling. All three models perform lookahead. Our most sophisticated (and novel) model leverages the FST structure to consider the graph of future paths; unfortunately, we find that it loses out to the simpler approaches - except on an artificial task that we concocted to confuse the simpler approaches.",

    "abstract": "This chapter discusses the interaction of viruses with cell surface receptors. The rigorous characterizations of receptor-ligand interactions have been derived from binding studies of radiolabeled ligands in neuropharmacology and endocrinology. The definition of viral recognition sites as receptors involves three major criteria that are derived from models of ligand-receptor interactions: saturability, specificity, and competition. A variety of approaches have been used to study the interaction of viral particles with cell surface receptors or reception sites. A rigorous study of viral-receptor interactions requires the use of more than one technique as different approaches provide complementary information about viral binding. The chapter discusses membrane components that interact with viruses. The identification of the subviral components that are responsible for the binding of viruses to cell surfaces has preceded the structural understanding of the cellular receptors themselves. The chapter summarizes current data concerning the viral attachment protein (VAP) of selected viruses.",

Five hybridomas were found which secrete monoclonal antibodies that recognize ependymal cells both by indirect immunofluorescence and radioimmunoassay. One of them, Epenl, appears to be a relatively specific surface marker of murine and rat ependymal cells, whereas the 4 others also recognize neurons, astrocytes, and/or oligodendrocytes. Absorption of Epenl with murine cerebral cortex did not affect its binding, whereas absorption with ependymal cells abolished it. Labeling of in vivo sections with Epenl demonstrates prominent binding to ependymal cells lining ventricular cavities. Epenl does not bind to neurons or astrocytes in culture, and binds only minimally to isolated oligodendrocytes. It does, however, recognize an antigenic determinant present in lung tissue.",

    "abstract": "Reovirus type 3 inoculated intracerebrally or subcutaneously into newborn mice induced an acute necrotizing and uniformly fatal encephalitis. Subsequently, between the eighth and tenth day of age, reovirus type 3 infection changed to a nonlethal infection. This pattern of virulence was directly correlated with the ability of the virus to replicate in the brain and histologically was accompanied by a gradual diminution in the intensity and extent of encephalitis such that histological abnormalities were absent in the brains of virus-injected adult animals. Some animals injected at ages 10 to 18 days developed brainstem and diencephalic lesions, indicating a nonuniform resistance of neurons to viral infection with aging. Neither a changing immune response pattern nor a modification or loss of viral receptors appears to explain either the susceptibility of newborn or the resistance of adult animals to reovirus type 3 encephalitis. Splenic mononuclear cells from mice younger (but not older) than 7 days also permitted reovirus type 3 replication in vitro. Thus, the age dependent resistance to reovirus type 3 encephalitis appears related to an intrinsic resistance to viral replication by neuronal cells, a resistance that may occur simultaneously in nonneuronal cell populations.",

Most conventional approaches based on neural networks have problems dealing with such structured entities. The algorithms presented in this paper represent a novel approach to neural-symbolic integration that allows for symbolic data in the form of objects to be translated to a scalar representation that can then be used by connectionist systems. We present the implementation of two translation algorithms that aid in performing object-oriented function approximation. We argue that objects provide an abstract representation of data that is well suited for the input and output of neural networks, as well as other statistical learning techniques. By examining the results of a simple sorting example, we illustrate the efficacy of these techniques.",

We propose the Tensor Product Vision Transformer (TP-ViT), an enhancement of a Vision Transformer that incorporates TPRs, an object representation methodology that utilizes filler and role vectors to represent objects. TP-ViT is the first application of TPRs on visual input, and we report qualitative and quantitative results which show that the use of TPRs allows for the formation of more targeted and diverse object representations when compared to a standard Vision Transformer.",

    "year": "2025",
    "author": "Temel, M. C.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: In this case series, we present two male cases with renal parenchymal perforation without perirenal hematoma after D-J ureteral stent insertion, one with nutcracker renal vein syndrome. Our study provides new and important contributions to the field of science regarding what to consider during D-J stent insertion in similar cases and in patients with obstruction in the urinary collecting system for more than 2 months. CASE PRESENTATIONS: Two patients, 30 and 37 years old, who were inserted a D-J catheter after endoscopic ureteral stone treatment, suffered from severe ipsilateral flank pain and hematuria after the operation. The Kidney Urine Bladder (KUB) radiography showed that the proximal part of the D-J stent was protruding from the upper calyx and parenchyma of the kidney in both patients. One of the patients had an ipsilateral nutcracker renal vein syndrome, and the clinical progression was more severe. In both cases, conventional follow-up with bed rest, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) therapy, intravenous (IV) fluid infusion, and anti-biotherapy after the D-J stent reposition was sufficient. The patients had no clinical problems during the next outpatient clinic visits. CONCLUSION: Double-j (D-J) ureteral stent insertion procedure may cause many life-threatening complications, from subcapsular hematoma to pulmonary embolism. In this case series, conventional follow-up was sufficient for the treatment of patients with renal parenchymal damage without perirenal hematoma due to D-J stent insertion, including nutcracker renal vein syndrome cases. More care should be taken when placing D-J stents, especially in patients with obstruction in the urinary collecting system for more than 2 months and with nutcracker renal vein syndrome. In these patients, the soft proximal end of the guidewire should not be pushed and forced too hard to the upper part of the kidney and upper collecting system. Additionally, the D-J stent placement procedure should be performed under fluoroscopy as much as possible to avoid complications.",

Here, we report on the open-label, single-arm, phase IIIB 4EVER trial (NCT01626222). This trial evaluated the clinical effectiveness of everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- aBC who had progressed on or after an NSAI, but with no restrictions on the time of progression after NSAI, prior chemotherapy for advanced disease or previous exemestane. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR; i.e. the percentage of patients with a best overall response of complete or partial response per RECIST 1.1) within the first 24 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints included PFS, overall survival, safety and health-related quality of life. Between June 2012 and November 2013, 299 patients were enrolled at 82 German centers: 281 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 299 for safety. The ORR was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.8-12.9%). Median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI: 5.4-6.0 months). The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were stomatitis (8.4%), general physical health deterioration (6.7%), dyspnea (4.7%) and anemia (4.3%). The ORR in 4EVER was lower than in BOLERO-2, likely due to inclusion of patients with more advanced disease and extensive pretreatment. These data confirm the clinical benefits and known safety profile of everolimus plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- aBC.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic rule learners generate interpretable solutions, however they require the input to be encoded symbolically. Neuro-symbolic approaches overcome this issue by mapping raw data to latent symbolic concepts using a neural network. Training the neural and symbolic components jointly is difficult, due to slow and unstable learning, hence many existing systems rely on hand-engineered rules to train the network. We introduce NeuralFastLAS, a scalable and fast end-to-end approach that trains a neural network jointly with a symbolic learner. For a given task, NeuralFastLAS computes a relevant set of rules, proved to contain an optimal symbolic solution, trains a neural network using these rules, and finally finds an optimal symbolic solution to the task while taking network predictions into account. A key novelty of our approach is learning a posterior distribution on rules while training the neural network to improve stability during training. We provide theoretical results for a sufficient condition on network training to guarantee correctness of the final solution. Experimental results demonstrate that NeuralFastLAS is able to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in arithmetic and logical tasks, with a training time that is up to two orders of magnitude faster than other jointly trained neuro-symbolic methods.",

    "abstract": "Detecting novel product defects whose classes have not been seen at all during training time, is an important aspect of practical automated visual inspection in manufacturing. Without proper handling it is possible that these unknown defects will remain unnoticed causing production quality to deteriorate. Collecting more and more defect data is also not a solution as defects occur rarely in production and the ramp-up time of the AI-driven quality inspector becomes significantly slower. Since traditional machine algorithms are not always designed for handling these challenges, this paper applies an innovative approach based on Neurosymbolic AI. Specifically, we use a Logic Tensor Network that expresses the outputs of an unsupervised out-of-distribution detector as symbolic rules and uses them to drive the training of a neural network classifier. The resulting algorithm shows improved results in comparison to other related methods, especially in terms of defect recall, meaning that few defects remain undetected even if completely novel. More specifically, it achieves similar or better recall scores than semi-supervised and unsupervised methods when handling novel defects, but significantly outperforms them in defects that were seen during training. Similarly, when compared to supervised methods, it maintains high performance on known defects but significantly improves on novel ones. These best-of-both-worlds results are illustrated through higher F1-scores in the majority of the test datasets of manufacturing products.",

In this article, we delve into the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dealing with progressively complex analogies expressed in unstructured text. We discuss analogies at four distinct levels of complexity: lexical analogies, syntactic analogies, semantic analogies, and pragmatic analogies. As the analogies become more complex, they require increasingly extensive, diverse knowledge beyond the textual content, unlikely to be found in the lexical co-occurrence statistics that power LLMs. To address this, we discuss the necessity of employing Neuro-symbolic AI techniques that combine statistical and symbolic AI, informing the representation of unstructured text to highlight and augment relevant content, provide abstraction and guide the mapping process. Our knowledge-informed approach maintains the efficiency of LLMs while preserving the ability to explain analogies for pedagogical applications.",

    "abstract": "It remains a challenge to provide safety guarantees for autonomous systems with neural perception and control. A typical approach obtains symbolic bounds on perception error (e.g., using conformal prediction) and performs verification under these bounds. However, these bounds can lead to drastic conservatism in the resulting end-to-end safety guarantee. This paper proposes an approach to synthesize symbolic perception error bounds that serve as an optimal interface between perception performance and control verification. The key idea is to consider our error bounds to be heteroskedastic with respect to the system's state - not time like in previous approaches. These bounds can be obtained with two gradient-free optimization algorithms. We demonstrate that our bounds lead to tighter safety guarantees than the state-of-the-art in a case study on a mountain car.",

    "abstract": "AIMS: To study the survival processes of thermophilic Campylobacter spp. within a modelled aquatic system and particularly the involvement and survival potential of viable but non-culturable forms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The survival and morphological characteristics of populations of thermophilic Campylobacter species exposed to simulated aquatic conditions were examined using a combination of cultural and microscopic techniques. Populations underwent progressive decay when exposed to simulated aquatic conditions. The rates of population decay were observed to be significantly greater at the higher temperature (20 degrees C) with a rapid transition of the dominant sub-populations from non-stressed to dead cells occurred within 3 days. At 10 degrees C the rate of culturability loss was much reduced with substantial development (approx. 80% of total population) of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) populations by all species within 3 days, declining to represent approximately 5-25% of the total population at day 60. Significant differences (P < 0.001) were identified between decay rates as a consequence of different species, sub-populations and temperature but not between sub-populations of different species. Morphological variants including spiral, elongated spirals and rods, short rods and coccoid forms were identified. The endpoints of morphological transition were temperature-independent and isolate-specific yet the rate of morphological transition was directly related to temperature and approximately equivalent between species. CONCLUSION: The VBNC state is a transitory stage in the degeneration of Campylobacter population within the aquatic environments simulated during this study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: VBNC cells form the most persistent, viable, potentially pathogenic sub-population of Campylobacter populations exposed to aquatic stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Democratic societies need accessible, reliable information. Videos and Podcasts have established themselves as the medium of choice for civic dissemination, but also as carriers of misinformation. The emerging Science Communication Knowledge Infrastructure (SciCom KI) curating non-textual media is still fragmented and not adequately equipped to scale against the content flood. Our work sets out to support the SciCom KI with a central, collaborative platform, the SciCom Wiki, to facilitate FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) media representation and the fact-checking of their content, particularly for videos and podcasts. Building an open-source service system centered around Wikibase, we survey requirements from 53 stakeholders, refine these in 11 interviews, and evaluate our prototype based on these requirements with another 14 participants. To address the most requested feature, fact-checking, we developed a neurosymbolic computational fact-checking approach, converting heterogenous media into knowledge graphs. This increases machine-readability and allows comparing statements against equally represented ground-truth. Our computational fact-checking tool was iteratively evaluated through 10 expert interviews, a public user survey with 43 participants verified the necessity and usability of our tool. Overall, our findings identified several needs to systematically support the SciCom KI. The SciCom Wiki, as a FAIR digital library complementing our neurosymbolic computational fact-checking framework, was found suitable to address the raised requirements. Further, we identified that the SciCom KI is severely underdeveloped regarding FAIR knowledge and related systems facilitating its collaborative creation and curation. Our system can provide a central knowledge node, yet a collaborative effort is required to scale against the imminent (mis-)information flood.",

MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 are global, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 studies of abemaciclib/placebo + fulvestrant and abemaciclib/placebo + nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI, anastrozole or letrozole), respectively. The East Asian population comprised 212 (31.7%) of the 669 intent-to-treat (ITT) population in the MONARCH 2 trial and 144 (29.2%) of the 493 ITT patients in the MONARCH 3 trial. In the East Asian population, median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly prolonged in the abemaciclib arm compared with placebo in both MONARCH 2 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.520; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.362 to 0.747; P < .001; median: 21.2 vs 11.6 months) and MONARCH 3 (HR, 0.326; 95% CI, 0.200 to 0.531, P < .001; median: not reached vs 12.82 months). Diarrhea (MONARCH 2: 90%; MONARCH 3: 88%) and neutropenia (MONARCH 2: 68%; MONARCH 3: 58%) were the most frequent adverse events observed in the East Asian populations. Abemaciclib exposures and PK were similar in East Asians and the non-East Asian populations of both trials. Abemaciclib in combination with ET in the East Asian populations of MONARCH 2 and MONARCH 3 provided consistent results with the ITT populations, demonstrating improvements in efficacy with generally tolerable safety profiles for patients with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer.",

Due to the lack of effective therapy coverage for mental disorders, there is a need for an AI solution that can assist therapists with the diagnosis. However, current Neural Network models lack explainability and may not be trusted by therapists. The LNN is a Recurrent Neural Network architecture that combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of classical logic-based AI. The proposed system uses input predicates from clinical interviews to output a mental disorder class, and different predicate pruning techniques are used to achieve scalability and higher scores. In addition, we provide an insight extraction method to aid therapists with their diagnosis. The proposed system addresses the lack of explainability of current Neural Network models and provides a more trustworthy solution for mental disorder diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) representation learning aims to encode entities and relations into dense continuous vector spaces such that knowledge contained in a dataset could be consistently represented. Dense embeddings trained from KG datasets benefit a variety of downstream tasks such as KG completion and link prediction. However, existing KG embedding methods fell short to provide a systematic solution for the global consistency of knowledge representation. We developed a mathematical language for KG based on an observation of their inherent algebraic structure, which we termed as Knowledgebra. By analyzing five distinct algebraic properties, we proved that the semigroup is the most reasonable algebraic structure for the relation embedding of a general knowledge graph. We implemented an instantiation model, SemE, using simple matrix semigroups, which exhibits state-of-the-art performance on standard datasets. Moreover, we proposed a regularization-based method to integrate chain-like logic rules derived from human knowledge into embedding training, which further demonstrates the power of the developed language. As far as we know, by applying abstract algebra in statistical learning, this work develops the first formal language for general knowledge graphs, and also sheds light on the problem of neural-symbolic integration from an algebraic perspective.",

    "abstract": "User preference interests and logical requirements synergistically indicate users' desires, which influence the user's behaviors. While most models extract user preferences from interaction records, they frequently neglect the user's logical requirements, which are embedded in the logical relations between items and entities. Existing methods that account for user's logical requirements employ neural networks to mimic logical operators, failing to explicitly model logical relations. Therefore, we present a Logic Preference Fusion Reasoning (LPFR) framework on recommendation, which employs a neuro-symbolic approach to explicitly extract user preferences and logical requirements as user desires. Specifically, we design neuro-symbolic operators to compute from both feature and symbol perspectives, merging the computational benefits of embedding with the reasoning advantages of logic. Subsequently, we introduce a logic and preference reasoning module to reason user preferences and logical requirements explicitly, obtaining preference, logic and desire queries answer sets. This module allows LPFR to reason about user desires at perceptual and cognitive aspects, respectively. To explore specific information within the three answer sets, a co-guided fusion gate is introduced to mine mutual relations and co-guide learning. Experimental results indicate that our model surpasses existing baseline models.",

    "year": "2024",
    "author": "Frame, Tory and Padget, Julian and Stothart, George and Elizabeth, Coulthard",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Human trust is a prerequisite to trustworthy AI adoption, yet trust remains poorly understood. Trust is often described as an attitude, but attitudes cannot be reliably measured or managed. Additionally, humans frequently conflate trust in an AI system, its machine learning (ML) technology, and its other component parts. Without fully understanding the 'leap of faith' involved in trusting ML, users cannot develop intrinsic trust in these systems. A common approach to building trust is to explain a ML model's reasoning process. However, such explanations often fail to resonate with non-experts due to the inherent complexity of ML systems and explanations are disconnected from users' own (unarticulated) mental models. This work puts forward an innovative way of directly building intrinsic trust in ML, by discerning and measuring the Leap of Faith (LoF) taken when a user decides to rely on ML. The LoF matrix captures the alignment between an ML model and a human expert's mental model. This match is rigorously and practically identified by feeding the user's data and objective function into both an ML agent and an expert-validated rules-based agent: a verified point of reference that can be tested a priori against a user's own mental model. This represents a new class of neuro-symbolic architecture. The LoF matrix reveals to the user the distance that constitutes the leap of faith between the rules-based and ML agents. For the first time, we propose trust metrics that evaluate whether users demonstrate trust through their actions rather than self-reported intent and whether such trust is deserved based on outcomes. The significance of the contribution is that it enables empirical assessment and management of ML trust drivers, to support trustworthy ML adoption. The approach is illustrated through a long-term high-stakes field study: a 3-month pilot of a multi-agent sleep-improvement system.",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and logic programs have both been suggested as means of modelling human cognition. While ANNs are adaptable and relatively noise resistant, the information they represent is distributed across various neurons and is therefore difficult to interpret. On the contrary, symbolic systems such as logic programs are interpretable but less adaptable. Human cognition is performed in a network of biological neurons and yet is capable of representing symbols, and therefore an ideal model would combine the strengths of the two approaches. This is the goal of Neural-Symbolic Integration [4, 16, 21, 40], in which ANNs are used to produce interpretable, adaptable representations of logic programs and other symbolic models.One neural-symbolic model of reasoning is SHRUTI[89, 95], argued to exhibit biological plausibility in that it captures some aspects of real biological processes. SHRUTI’s original developers also suggest that further biological plausibility can be ascribed to the fact that SHRUTI networks can be represented by a model of genetic development [96, 120]. The aims of this thesis are to support the claims of SHRUTI’s developers by producing the first such genetic representation for SHRUTI networks and to explore biological plausibility further by investigating the evolvability of the proposed SHRUTI genome.The SHRUTI genome is developed and evolved using principles from Generative and Developmental Systems and Artificial Development [13, 105], in which genomes useindirect encodingto provide a set of instructions for the gradual development of the phenotype just as DNA does for biological organisms. This thesis presents genomes that develop SHRUTI representations of logical relations and episodic facts so that they are able to correctly answer questions on the knowledge they represent.The evolvability of the SHRUTI genomes is limited in that an evolutionary search was able to discover genomes for simple relational structures that did not include conjunction, but could not discover structures that enabled conjunctive relations or episodic facts to be learned. Experiments were performed to understand the SHRUTI fitness landscape and demonstrated that this landscape is unsuitable for navigation using an evolutionary search. Complex SHRUTI structures require that necessary substructures must be discovered in unison and not individually in order to yield a positive change in objective fitness that informs the evolutionary search of their discovery.The requirement for multiple substructures to be in place before fitness can be improved is probably owed to the localist representation of concepts and relations in SHRUTI. Therefore this thesis concludes by making a case for switching to more distributed representations as a possible means of improving evolvability in the future.",

    "abstract": "PURPOSE: Preclinical models suggest that the use of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy with antiestrogens may prevent or delay the development of endocrine therapy resistance. We therefore performed a feasibility study to evaluate the safety of letrozole plus bevacizumab in patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: Patients with locally advanced breast cancer or MBC were treated with the aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole (2.5 mg orally daily) and the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks). The primary end point was safety, defined by grade 4 toxicity using the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3.0. Secondary end points included response rate, clinical benefit rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). Prior nonsteroidal AIs (NSAIs) were permitted in the absence of progressive disease. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were treated. After a median of 13 cycles (range, 1 to 71 cycles), select treatment-related toxicities included hypertension (58%; grades 2 and 3 in 19% and 26%), proteinuria (67%; grades 2 and 3 in 14% and 19%), headache (51%; grades 2 and 3 in 16% and 7%), fatigue (74%; grades 2 and 3 in 19% and 2%), and joint pain (63%; grades 2 and 3 in 19% and 0%). Eighty-four percent of patients had at least stable disease on an NSAI, confounding efficacy results. Partial responses were seen in 9% of patients and stable disease >or= 24 weeks was noted in 67%. Median PFS was 17.1 months. CONCLUSION: Combination letrozole and bevacizumab was feasible with expected bevacizumab-related events of hypertension, headache, and proteinuria. Phase III proof-of-efficacy trials of endocrine therapy plus bevacizumab are in progress (Cancer and Leukemia Group B 40503).",

    "abstract": "Developments in deep learning have seen the use of layerwise unsupervised learning combined with supervised learning for fine-tuning. With this layerwise approach, a deep network can be seen as a more modular system that lends itself well to learning representations. In this paper, we investigate whether such modularity can be useful to the insertion of background knowledge into deep networks, whether it can improve learning performance when it is available, and to the extraction of knowledge from trained deep networks, and whether it can offer a better understanding of the representations learned by such networks. To this end, we use a simple symbolic language-a set of logical rules that we call confidence rules-and show that it is suitable for the representation of quantitative reasoning in deep networks. We show by knowledge extraction that confidence rules can offer a low-cost representation for layerwise networks (or restricted Boltzmann machines). We also show that layerwise extraction can produce an improvement in the accuracy of deep belief networks. Furthermore, the proposed symbolic characterization of deep networks provides a novel method for the insertion of prior knowledge and training of deep networks. With the use of this method, a deep neural-symbolic system is proposed and evaluated, with the experimental results indicating that modularity through the use of confidence rules and knowledge insertion can be beneficial to network performance.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Surgery and anesthesia cause otonomic, neuroendocrine and metabolic changes. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of epidural and intravenous analgesia on stress hormone responses during postoperative and perioperative periods of laparoscopic hiatal hernia operations. METHODS: 32 patients (ASA I-II) with ages ranging from 20 to 60 years undergoing laparoscopic hiatal hernia surgery were included in the study and the patients were randomly divided into two groups as Group GA, general anesthesia combined with intravenous analgesia; Group EA; General anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia. Anesthesia was induced with1 ?g kg-1 fentanyl, 2 mg kg-1 propofol and atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1, and general anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and air-oxygen mixture. In the Group GA, fentanyl was administered intermittently during intraoperative period. Postoperative analgesia was provided with tramadol in the recovery room, and with NSAI drugs and paracetamol in the surgical ward. In the Group EA, epidural catheterization was performed before induction of anesthesia through T8-T10. As a bolus dosage, 0.5 % bupivacaine + 1 mg morphine in 10 mL normal saline was applied as administered to the patients. A 0.09 % NaCl, 80 mL and 0.5 % bupivacaine, 20 mL +10 mg morphine mixture was prepared for the postoperative period. Epidural infusion was started with the basal infusion of a bolus dosage of 2 mL delivered at a rate of 4 ml h-1 and 30 minute lock time for analgesia. Blood samples were collected before surgery, 30 min and 120 min after surgery and 24 h postoperatively for the determination of cortisol, ADH, insulin, glucose and IL-6 levels.? RESULTS: There were no significant intergroup differences in stress hormone levels before and after surgery except glucose levels at the 6th hour of postoperative period (p=0,021). In Groups GA and EA significant changes was determined throught the study related with surgical stress response CONCLUSION: ?Thoracal epidural anesthesia and intravenous fentanyl supplemented group attenuate the surgical stress response in the same level. This result may be due to the inability of epidural analgesia to block noxious stimulation during laparoscopic surgery.",

    "abstract": "Nabumetone is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drug which is known to cause less gastrointestinal damage than other NSAI drugs. This study was performed to evaluate whether nabumetone treatment might alter the vascular aberrations related to inflammation in a rat model of adjuvant-induced arthritis. Nabumetone treatment (120 or 240 mg.kg(-1).day(-1), orally) was initiated on the 15th day of adjuvant inoculation and continued for 14 days. Arthritic lesions, vascular contractile and relaxant responses and gastroduodenal histopathological preparations were evaluated 29 days after adjuvant inoculation. The contractile responses of aortic rings to phenylephrine and KCl were increased in grade 2 arthritic rats. In grade 3 arthritis only the phenylephrine contractility was decreased. The relaxant responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were decreased in grades 2 and 3. In healthy rats, nabumetone did not change the vascular responses. After treatment of arthritic rats with nabumetone, both the contractile and relaxant response of the aortic rings returned to normal, and arthritic score and paw swelling were reduced. Gastroduodenal histopathology did not show erosions or ulcers in any of the groups. in conclusion, nabumetone improved the systemic signs and vascular alterations in experimental arthritis without showing any gastrointestinal side effects.

    "abstract": "Non-markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks are extremely hard to solve, because intelligent agents must consider the entire history of state-action pairs to act rationally in the environment. Most works use Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to specify temporally-extended tasks. This approach applies only in finite and discrete state environments or continuous problems for which a mapping between the continuous state and a symbolic interpretation is known as a symbol grounding function. In this work, we define Visual Reward Machines (VRM), an automata-based neurosymbolic framework that can be used for both reasoning and learning in non-symbolic non-markovian RL domains. VRM is a fully neural but interpretable system, that is based on the probabilistic relaxation of Moore Machines. Results show that VRMs can exploit ungrounded symbolic temporal knowledge to outperform baseline methods based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in non-markovian visual domains.",

    "abstract": "A critical challenge in neurosymbolic approaches is to handle the symbol grounding problem without direct supervision. That is mapping high-dimensional raw data into an interpretation over a finite set of abstract concepts with a known meaning, without using labels. In this work, we ground symbols into sequences of images by exploiting symbolic logical knowledge in the form of Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) formulas, and sequence-level labels expressing if a sequence of images is compliant or not with the given formula. Our approach is based on translating the LTLf formula into an equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) and interpreting the latter in fuzzy logic. Experiments show that our system outperforms recurrent neural networks in sequence classification and can reach high image classification accuracy without being trained with any single-image label.",

Patients and methods. - The program has been developed according to the French standards of accreditation. After elaboration of a referential, a first study ( 103 patients) allowed to evaluate the ongoing practices and to appreciate the pain intensities. After analysis of the results, an action strategy has been elaborated. with a brand new therapeutic standard and a pain-monitoring program for nurses. Six months later. a second study ( 105 patients) measured the efficiency of the accomplished actions. The statistic analysis used chi(2) and Kruskal-Wallis tests and a niultivariate analyse (p <0.05). Results. - Several indicators led to conclude to the Success of this program: analgesics prescribed systematically and earlier. best observance, larger utilisation of the NSAI, decrease of the analgesics requests, improvement of the satisfaction referred to the relief of pain. The multivariate analyse showed a risk twice as little as in the second study to have a 36th hour VAS score superior to four (p =0.03). Conclusion. - The apply of this quality insurance program allowed to improve the analgesia after obstetric perineal injuries. A few adaptations are needed. and also more formations of the medical and paramedical staff. The durability of the accomplished actions shall be evaluated in the future. (C) 2004 Elsevier SAS.

    "abstract": "The tension between deduction and induction is perhaps the most fundamental issue in areas such as philosophy, cognition and artificial intelligence (AI). The deduction camp concerns itself with questions about the expressiveness of formal languages for capturing knowledge about the world, together with proof systems for reasoning from such knowledge bases. The learning camp attempts to generalize from examples about partial descriptions about the world. In AI, historically, these camps have loosely divided the development of the field, but advances in cross-over areas such as statistical relational learning, neuro-symbolic systems, and high-level control have illustrated that the dichotomy is not very constructive, and perhaps even ill-formed. In this article, we survey work that provides further evidence for the connections between logic and learning. Our narrative is structured in terms of three strands: logic versus learning, machine learning for logic, and logic for machine learning, but naturally, there is considerable overlap. We place an emphasis on the following \"sore\" point: there is a common misconception that logic is for discrete properties, whereas probability theory and machine learning, more generally, is for continuous properties. We report on results that challenge this view on the limitations of logic, and expose the role that logic can play for learning in infinite domains.",

    "year": "2015",
    "author": "Varadarajan, Karthik Mahesh and Markus, Vincze",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Inter-Robot Communication (ICI) are rapidly evolving fields with little standardization. A number of middleware architectures, frameworks and programming languages exist for implementing algorithms on robots. Also, efforts have been made to enable robots to understand the multitude of natural languages available. Nevertheless, there is definite lack of intermediary languages for the representation of symbol grounding mechanisms in robots and standards for inter-robot cognitive communication. We address this void by presenting an intermediary meta-language based on a perceptually grounded algorithmic alphabet the Affordance and kTR Augmented Alphabet based Neuro-Symbolic language, in short Af-kTRAANS, yielding an abstract layer sandwiched between the natural and the programming language layers that robots can use for knowledge representation, sharing and communication, while being agnostic to the embodiment, the pertinent human language, as well as, socio-cultural contexts and environments. Based on the k-TR theory of cognitive visual perception and implemented for practical systems using the Affordance Network (AfNet) and the AfRob ontology, the graphical language can support a wide variety of object definition phrases as well as action verbs/object interaction commands while providing the necessary succinctness for tractable modeling. The various aspects of this cognitive inter-robot communication language are presented in this paper. Several examples of usage of the graphical language for common robotic task based queries are demonstrated along with the grounding mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Microbial cultures repurposing organic industrial residues for value-added metabolite production is pivotal for sustainable resource use. Highlighting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), renowned for their nutritional and therapeutic value. Notably, Zygomycetes' filamentous fungi harbor abundant GLA-rich lipid content, furthering their relevance in this approach. In this study, the strain C. elegans NRRL Y-1392 was evaluated for its capability to metabolize glycerol and produce lipids rich in GLA under different culture conditions. Various carbon-to-nitrogen ratios (C/N = 11.0, 110.0, and 220.0 mol/mol) were tested in batch-flask cultivations. The highest GLA production of 224.0 mg/L (productivity equal to 2.0 mg/L/h) was observed under nitrogen excess conditions, while low nitrogen content promoted lipid accumulation (0.59 g of lipids per g of dry biomass) without yielding more PUFAs and GLA. After improving the C/N ratio at 18.3 mol/mol, even higher PUFA (600 mg/L) and GLA (243 mg/L) production values were recorded. GLA content increased when the fungus was cultivated at 12 °C (15.5% w/w compared to 12.8% w/w at 28 °C), but productivity values decreased significantly due to prolonged cultivation duration. An attempt to improve productivity by increasing the initial spore population did not yield the expected results. The successful scale-up of fungal cultivations is evidenced by achieving consistent results (compared to flask experiments under corresponding conditions) in both laboratory-scale (Working Volume-Vw = 1.8 L; C/N = 18.3 mol/mol) and semi-pilot-scale (Vw = 15.0 L; C/N = 110.0 mol/mol) bioreactor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, cultivation of the fungus Cunninghamella elegans in glycerol-based substrates, especially in 20 L bioreactor experiments, has never been previously reported in the international literature. The successful scale-up of the process in a semi-pilot-scale bioreactor illustrates the potential for industrializing the bioprocess.",

    "abstract": "The chemical synthesis and biological evaluation of several potential irreversible inhibitors for prostaglandin (PGH) synthase are described. These inhibitors were modeled after the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory (NSAI) drug phenylbutazone (4-n-butyl-1,2-diphenyl-3,5-pyrazolidinedione). Electrophilic functionalities such as an .alpha.-bromoacetamide, an .alpha.-chloroacetamide, a phenylurethane, a propargyl chloride, and several .alpha.,.beta.-unsaturated Michael acceptors were incorporated at the 4-position of the pyrazolidinedione ring structure. None of the derivatives showed evidence of irreversible inhibition of PGH synthase, although several were nearly as potent inhibitors of this enzyme as phenylbutazone. The nitrile obtained from 1,4-conjugate addition of cyanide to one of the unsaturated derivatives was considerably more potent as an inhibitor of PGH synthase than was phenylbutazone.",

    "abstract": "Past research has demonstrated that large neural language models (LMs) encode surprising amounts of factual information: however, augmenting or modifying this information requires modifying a corpus and retraining, which is computationally expensive. To address this problem, we develop a neural LM that includes an interpretable neuro-symbolic KB in the form of a ``fact memory '' . Each element of the fact memory is formed from a triple of vectors, where each vector corresponds to a KB entity or relation. Our LM improves performance on knowledge-intensive question-answering tasks, sometimes dramatically, including a 27 point increase in one setting of WebQuestionsSP over a state-of-the-art open-book model, despite using 5% of the parameters. Most interestingly, we demonstrate that the model can be modified, without any re-training, by updating the fact memory.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neural probabilistic logic systems follow the neuro-symbolic (NeSy) paradigm by combining the perceptive and learning capabilities of neural networks with the robustness of probabilistic logic. Learning corresponds to likelihood optimization of the neural networks. However, to obtain the likelihood exactly, expensive probabilistic logic inference is required. To scale learning to more complex systems, we therefore propose to instead optimize a sampling based objective. We prove that the objective has a bounded error with respect to the likelihood, which vanishes when increasing the sample count. Furthermore, the error vanishes faster by exploiting a new concept of sample diversity. We then develop the EXPLAIN, AGREE, LEARN (EXAL) method that uses this objective. EXPLAIN samples explanations for the data. AGREE reweighs each explanation in concordance with the neural component. LEARN uses the reweighed explanations as a signal for learning. In contrast to previous NeSy methods, EXAL can scale to larger problem sizes while retaining theoretical guarantees on the error. Experimentally, our theoretical claims are verified and EXAL outperforms recent NeSy methods when scaling up the MNIST addition and Warcraft pathfinding problems.",

    "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this paper was to evaluate the efficacy (0= none; 3= fully) of the treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs on (a) gland post-inflammatory echopattern, by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS); (b) seminal cytologic (WBC concentration and spermiophagies) and (c) >2 physicochemical inflammatory parameters in patients with chronic amicrobial prostato-vesiculitis (PV). METHODS: Thirty-five patients with PV received NSAI drugs in the following intermittently steps (over a 3-month period): 1) Pygeum 100 mg twice a day for 14 consecutive days per month; 2) flavoxate-propyphenazone 400 mg twice a day plus Serratiopeptidase 10 000 U twice a day for the subsequent 14 days per month. All patients underwent semen analysis and TRUS scans in the pre-treatment and after 3 months of therapy. RESULTS: The fully (a+b+c) efficacy rate, through an improvement of TRUS prostatic or vesicular echopattern in 37.1% and 22.8% respectively, was higher than that registered with an improvement of only 1 or 2 endpoints. Altogether, the following TRUS findings showed reductions (range 25-40%): prostate volume and hypochogenicity (51.4%); vesicular antero-posterior diameter (APD) in the 43.5% and 28.6% of the uni- and bilateral PV respectively; vesicular wall tickness (25%); unilateral vesicular honeycomb aspect (36%). No efficacy, mainly related to immodified TRUS prostatic or vesicular echopattern in 51.4% and 65.7% respectively, was observed on: areas of prostatic hyperechogenicity; peri-prostatic venous congestion; vesicular APD <7 mm or >21 mm (with honeycomb aspect). CONCLUSIONS: In PV patients, the treatment with NSAI compounds was effective when it was enable to produce multiple positive effects, mainly through TRUS changes.",

This position paper examines the challenges and research opportunities in integrating KGs with neuro-symbolic AI, highlighting their potential to enhance explainability, scalability, and context-aware reasoning in hybrid AI systems. Using a lung cancer use case, we illustrate how hybrid approaches address tasks such as link prediction-uncovering hidden relationships in medical data-and counterfactual reasoning-analyzing alternative scenarios to understand causal factors. The discussion is framed around TrustKG, which demonstrates how constraint validation, causal reasoning, and user-centric communication can support transparent and reliable decision-making. Additionally, we identify current limitations of KGs, including gaps in knowledge coverage, evolving data integration challenges, and the need for improved usability and impact assessment. These insights are not limited to healthcare but extend to other domains like energy, manufacturing, and mobility, showcasing the broad applicability of KGs. Finally, we propose research directions to unlock their full potential in building robust, transparent, and widely adopted real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "We tested the hypothesis that the neural code of retinal ganglion cells is optimized to transmit visual information at minimal metabolic cost. Under a broad ensemble of light patterns, ganglion cell spike trains consisted of sparse, precise bursts of spikes. These bursts were viewed as independent neural symbols. The noise in each burst was measured via repeated presentation of the visual stimulus, and the energy cost was estimated from the total charge flow in a biophysically realistic model of ganglion cell spiking. Given these costs and noise, the theory of efficient codes predicts an optimal distribution of symbol usage. Symbols that are either noisy or metabolically costly are suppressed in this optimal code. We found excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the measured distribution of burst sizes for ganglion cells in the tiger salamander retina.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive actions are frequently taken with the expectation of a particular result in mind. The expectation is generally based on past experiences, but not necessarily on any specific experience in isolation; rather, the integrated collection of past experiences forms the basis for what we should expect. Although an important part of action execution, this aspect of cognition has Largely been ignored in many architectures. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of expectation generation by using ACT-R's blending mechanism. Rather than returning a single particular chunk from memory, as ACT-R's normal declarative retrieval does, the blending mechanism returns a chunk whose slot values are generated via a weighted average over all the chunks in the set that matches the request, with the activations of the chunks themselves serving as the weights. In past work, this retrieval mechanism has been used to implement prototype generation from memory as well as to generate certainty measures from metacognitive signals. We embed the expectation generation capability within the larger SAL (Synthesis of ACT-R and Leabra) framework, a hybrid framework developed to take advantage of the relative strengths of the two architectures, and discuss directions for future work, including error monitoring and recovery.

    "abstract": "Prostaglandin (PG) actions on disc metabolism are unclear even though certain PGs are highly expressed by disc cells under inflammatory conditions and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAI Ds) are frequently used to block PG production to treat back pain. Hence this study aimed to (1) quantify gene expression of arachiclonic acid cascade components responsible for PG synthesis and (2) examine the effects of key PGs on disc matrix homeostasis Microarray analysis revealed that inflammatory stress increases expression of synthases and receptors for prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) and prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF(2 alpha)), resulting in elevated PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha) production in conditioned mocha of disc cells PGE(2) diminished disc cell proteoglycan synthesis, in a dose-dependent manner Semiquantitative RT-PGR revealed differential effects of PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha) on disc cell expression of key matrix structural genes. aggrecan, versican, collagens type I and II PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha) also decreased message for the anabolic factor, IGF-1 PGE2 decreased mRNA expression for the anti-catabolic factor TIMP-1 while PGF(2 alpha) increased mRNAs for catabolic factors MMP-1 and MMP-3 Thus, PGE(2) and PGF(2 alpha) may have an overall negative impact on disc matrix homeostasis, and the use of NSAIDs may impact disc metabolism is well as treat back pain (C) 2010 Orthopaedic Research Society Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc J Orthop Res 28 1259-1266, 2010",

    "abstract": "Current research in the area of concept learning makes use of deep learning and ensembles methods to learn concepts. Concept learning allows us to combine heterogeneous entities in data which could collectively identify as individual concepts. Heterogeneity and compositionality are crucial areas to explore in machine learning as it has the potential to contribute profoundly to artificial general intelligence. We investigate the use of spiking neural networks for concept learning. Spiking neurones inclusively model the temporal properties as observed in biological neurones. A benefit of spike-based neurones allows for localised learning rules that only adapts connections between relevant neurones. In this position paper, we propose a technique allowing dynamic formation of synapse (connections) in spiking neural networks, the basis of structural plasticity. Achieving dynamic formation of synapse allows for a unique approach to concept learning with a malleable neural structure. We call this technique Neurosymbolic Spike-Concept Learner (NS-SCL). The limitations of NS-SCL can be overcome with the neuromorphic computing paradigm. Furthermore, introducing NS-SCL as a technique on neuromorphic platforms should motivate a new direction of research towards Neuromorphic General Intelligence (NGI), a term we define to some extent.",

    "abstract": "In line with the general trend in artificial intelligence research to create intelligent systems that combine learning and symbolic techniques (a.k.a. neuro-symbolic systems), a new sub-area has emerged that focuses on combining machine learning (ML) components with techniques developed by the SemanticWeb (SW) community - SemanticWeb Machine Learning (SWeML for short). Due to the rapid growth of this area and its impact on several communities in the last two decades, there is a need to better understand the space of these SWeML Systems, their characteristics, and trends. Of particular interest are the emerging variations of processing patterns used in these systems in terms of their inputs/outputs and the order of the processing units. While several such neuro-symbolic system patterns were identified previously from a large number of papers, there is currently no insight into their adoption in the field, e.g., about the completeness of the introduced system patterns, or about their usage frequency. To fill that gap, we performed a systematic study and analyzed nearly 500 papers published in the last decade in this area, where we focused on evaluating the type and frequency of such system patterns. Overall we discovered 41 different system patterns, which we categorized into six pattern types. In this chapter we detail these pattern types, exemplify their use in concrete papers and discuss their characteristics in terms of their semantic and machine learning modules.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performances in generic question-answering (QA) but often suffer from domain gaps and outdated knowledge in smart manufacturing (SM). Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on LLMs has emerged as a potential approach by incorporating an external knowledge base. However, conventional vector-based RAG delivers rapid responses but often returns contextually vague results, while knowledge graph (KG)-based methods offer structured relational reasoning at the expense of scalability and efficiency. To address these challenges, a hybrid KG-Vector RAG framework that systematically integrates structured KG metadata with unstructured vector retrieval is proposed. Firstly, a metadata-enriched KG was constructed from domain corpora by systematically extracting and indexing structured information to capture essential domain-specific relationships. Secondly, semantic alignment was achieved by injecting domainspecific constraints to refine and enhance the contextual relevance of the knowledge representations. Lastly, a layered hybrid retrieval strategy was employed that combined the explicit reasoning capabilities of the KG with the efficient search power of vector-based similarity methods, and the resulting outputs were integrated via prompt engineering to generate comprehensive, context-aware responses. Evaluated on design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) tasks, the proposed approach achieved 77.8% exact match accuracy and 76.5% context precision. This study establishes a new paradigm for industrial LLM systems, which demonstrates that hybrid symbolic-neural architectures can overcome the precision-scalability trade-off in mission-critical manufacturing applications. Experimental results indicated that integrating structured KG information with vector-based retrieval and prompt engineering can enhance retrieval accuracy, contextual relevance, and efficiency in LLMbased Q&A systems for SM.",

An elegant approach to represent this intricate factorization is via high-dimensional holographic vectors drawing on brain-inspired vector symbolic architectures. However, holographic factorization involves iterative computation with high-dimensional matrix-vector multiplications and suffers from non-convergence problems. In this paper, we present H3DFACT, a heterogeneous 3D integrated in-memory compute engine capable of efficiently factorizing high-dimensional holographic representations. H3DFACT exploits the computation-in-superposition capability of holographic vectors and the intrinsic stochasticity associated with memristive-based 3D compute-in-memory. Evaluated on large-scale factorization and perceptual problems, H3DFACT demonstrates superior capability in factorization accuracy and operational capacity by up to five orders of magnitude, with 5.5x compute density, 1.2x energy efficiency improvements, and 5.9x less silicon footprint compared to iso-capacity 2D designs.",

In which out-of-distribution settings does each paradigm excel? We investigate this question on both single-image and multi-image visual question-answering through four types of generalization tests: a novel segment-combine test for multi-image queries, contrast set, compositional generalization, and cross-benchmark transfer. Vision-and-language end-to-end trained systems exhibit sizeable performance drops across all these tests. Neuro-symbolic methods suffer even more on cross-benchmark transfer from GQA to VQA, but they show smaller accuracy drops on the other generalization tests and their performance quickly improves by few-shot training. Overall, our results demonstrate the complementary benefits of these two paradigms, and emphasize the importance of using a diverse suite of generalization tests to fully characterize model robustness to distribution shift.",

The key technical challenge is that QDMR only contains sub-questions but not answers to those sub-questions, so we treat sub-answers as latent variables and optimize them using a novel dynamic mixture of Hard-EM and MAPO. Chain-of-Questions greatly outperforms strong neuro-symbolic methods by 9.0 F1 on DROP contrast set, and outperforms GPT-3.5 by 24.3 F1 on HOTPOTQA adversarial set, thus demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.",

    "abstract": "Human decision-making, as well as control of autonomous systems, have deployed deep learning models for detecting complex events from unstructured sensory data. However, the strong performance of these models is restricted to events with short intervals of time and space due to the limited context memory of their architectures. Thus, detecting events that transpire over long periods of time with multiple spatially distant sensor sources (known as complex events) remains challenging for these purely neural-based methods, particularly as environmental conditions and object appearances change. In recent years, neurosymbolic approaches have been proposed that use both neural-based perception and symbolic reasoning for capturing complex events. However, these approaches still face issues of adaptation to perceptual domain shift in complex events. We address these problems in the context of a prototype neurosymbolic system called DANCER, which performs Domain Adaptation and Neurosymbolic inference in Complex Event Reasoning. DANCER aims to provide domain adaptation in a post-deployment setting while minimizing runtime user burden for annotation. To enable training and evaluation of DANCER, we also provide a physics-based synthetic sensor data generator to create videos given complex scenario specifications. We evaluate DANCER on a dataset of generated synthetic data. We show that DANCER yields a 48% increase in accuracy of complex event detection using domain adaptation while significantly reducing the annotation time of our synthetic complex events by up to 2.7x, demonstrating DANCER's ability to effectively detect complex events under perceptual domain shift.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies revealed that unstable ventilation control is one of mechanisms underlying the occurrence of sleep apnea. Thus, we investigated whether TASK-1, an acid-sensitive potassium channel, plays a role in the occurrence of sleep apnea. First, the expression of TASK-1 transcriptions on brainstem was checked by in situ hybridization. Then, the correlation between the central apneic episodes and protein contents of TASK-1 measured by western blot was analyzed from 27 male rats. Results showed that TASK-1 mRNAs were widely distributed on the putative central chemoreceptors such as locus coeruleus, nucleus tractus solitarius and medullary raphe, etc. Both the total spontaneous apnea index (TSAI) and spontaneous apnea index in NREM sleep (NSAI) were positively correlated with TASK-1 protein contents (r=0.547 and 0.601, respectively, p<0.01). However, the post-sigh sleep apnea index (PAI) had no relationship with TASK-1 protein. Thus, we concluded that TASK-1 channels may function as central chemoreceptors that play a role in spontaneous sleep apneas in rats.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Recently, brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC), an emerging neuro-symbolic computing scheme that imitates human brain functions to process information using abstract and high-dimensional patterns, has seen increasing applications in multiple application domains and deployment in edge-cloud collaborative processing. However, sending sensitive data to the cloud for inference may face severe privacy threats. Unfortunately, HDC is particularly vulnerable to privacy threats due to its reversible nature. To address this challenge, we propose PP-HDC, a novel privacy-preserving inference framework for HDC. PP-HDC is designed to protect the privacy of both inference input and output. To preserve the privacy of inference input, we propose a novel hash-encoding approach in high-dimensional space by implementing a sliding-window-based transformation on the input hypervector (HV). By leveraging the unique mathematical properties of HDC, we are able to seamlessly perform training and inference on the hash-encoded HV with negligible overhead. For inference output privacy, we propose a multi-model inference approach to encrypt the inference results by leveraging the unique structure of HDC item memories and ensuring the inference result is only accessible to the owner with a proper key. We evaluate PP-HDC on three datasets and demonstrate that PP-HDC enhances privacy-preserving effects compared with state-of-the-art works while incurring minimal accuracy loss.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in language models have facilitated the development of agent-based systems. Despite their encouraging results in various reasoning tasks, these systems often operate as ``black boxes '' , raising concerns about potential illegal behavior due to opaque decision-making processes. This concern is particularly critical in autonomous driving, where precise decision-making requires a thorough understanding of traffic scenes and strict adherence to established norms. In this paper, we propose a legally-guided automated decision making system (LAD) that employs language models to dynamically retrieve facts for related rules through context-based query generation while delegating decisionmaking to a symbolic solver. In our experiments, we demonstrate that this neuro-symbolic system, with a limited number of formalized traffic rules, provides a more accurate, interpretable, and traceable solution for rule-compliant decision-making compared to pure language models.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "For many reasoning-heavy tasks involving raw inputs, it is challenging to design an appropriate end-to-end learning pipeline. Neuro-Symbolic Learning, divide the process into sub-symbolic perception and symbolic reasoning, trying to utilise data-driven machine learning and knowledge-driven reasoning simultaneously. However, they suffer from the exponential computational complexity within the interface between these two components, where the sub-symbolic learning model lacks direct supervision, and the symbolic model lacks accurate input facts. Hence, most of them assume the existence of a strong symbolic knowledge base and only learn the perception model while avoiding a crucial problem: where does the knowledge come from? In this paper, we present Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning (Meta\\_ Abd ) that unites abduction and induction to learn neural networks and induce logic theories jointly from raw data. Experimental results demonstrate that Meta\\_ Abd not only outperforms the compared systems in predictive accuracy and data efficiency but also induces logic programs that can be re-used as background knowledge in subsequent learning tasks. To the best of our knowledge, Meta\\_ Abd is the first system that can jointly learn neural networks from scratch and induce recursive first-order logic theories with predicate invention.",

    "abstract": "The study of machine learning-based logical query answering enables reasoning with large-scale and incomplete knowledge graphs. This paper advances this area of research by addressing the uncertainty inherent in knowledge. While the uncertain nature of knowledge is widely recognized in the real world, it does not align seamlessly with the first-order logic that underpins existing studies. To bridge this gap, we explore the soft queries on uncertain knowledge, inspired by the framework of soft constraint programming. We propose a neural symbolic approach that incorporates both forward inference and backward calibration to answer soft queries on large-scale, incomplete, and uncertain knowledge graphs. Theoretical discussions demonstrate that our method avoids catastrophic cascading errors in the forward inference while maintaining the same complexity as state-of-the-art symbolic methods for complex logical queries. Empirical results validate the superior performance of our backward calibration compared to extended query embedding methods and neural symbolic approaches.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The haemodynamic effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs can be attributed either to their common property of inhibiting the formation of prostaglandins (PG) in the cardiovascular system, or to direct actions on the tone and sensitivity of the resistance vessels in various regions. Indomethacin (IND) is the most frequently studied NSAI drug, in animals and in man. Its cardiovascular effects differ somewhat from those of other NSAI, due to the fact that, besides inhibiting PG formation, IND acts as a direct vasoconstrictor. The stimulatory effect of IND in vascular smooth muscle results in an increased systemic vascular resistance which, although partially compensated by a decreased cardiac output, gives rise to a moderate increase in systemic blood pressure. The vasoconstrictor effect of IND is of particular interest in patients with ischemic heart disease, since it lowers their already decreased coronary flow, and may thereby accentuate the risk of myocardial infarction. Administration of IND also leads to a decreased blood flow in the splanchnic region, the kidneys, and the brain. The cerebral blood flow is lowered by 25-35%; in addition, IND almost entirely erases the hyperemic flow response to hypercapnia. Of other NSAI drugs, at least aspirin and naproxen are completely devoid of such actions on the cerebral circulation. A common vascular effect of all NSAI drugs is a diminution of reactive hyperemia, the local hyperemia that develops in a tissue subjected to a short period of arterial occlusion. Part of this hyperemic response is dependent on an intact vascular PG formation and consequently it is inhibited when PG formation is blocked. In contrast, NSAI drugs do not affect the functional increase in the blood flow in working skeletal muscle.",

All three treatments, i.e. NSAI drug + carrageenan paw oedema + mild chilling treatment, were required for the development of this condition. Histological observations suggest that the tissue necrosis was initiated by a primary disturbance of the peripheral vasculature. The possible involvement of suppressed prostaglandin (PG) production in the aetiology of this condition is indicated by the fact that it was totally reversed by prior treatment with PGE2. This appears to be a classical pluricausal thrombohaemorrhagic phenomenon (of Selye), with cold-stress being the sensitizer and carrageenan and NSAI drugs being the challenger.

    "year": "2021",
    "author": "Wickramarachchi, R. and Henson, C. and Sheth, A.",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Scene understanding is a key technical challenge within the autonomous driving domain. It requires a deep semantic understanding of the entities and relations found within complex physical and social environments that is both accurate and complete. In practice, this can be accomplished by representing entities in a scene and their relations as a knowledge graph (KG). This scene knowledge graph may then be utilized for the task of entity prediction, leading to improved scene understanding. In this paper, we will define and formalize this problem as Knowledge-based Entity Prediction (KEP). KEP aims to improve scene understanding by predicting potentially unrecognized entities by leveraging heterogeneous, high-level semantic knowledge of driving scenes. An innovative neuro-symbolic solution for KEP is presented, based on knowledge-infused learning, which 1) introduces a dataset agnostic ontology to describe driving scenes, 2) uses an expressive, holistic representation of scenes with knowledge graphs, and 3) proposes an effective, non-standard mapping of the KEP problem to the problem of link prediction (LP) using knowledge-graph embeddings (KGE). Using real, complex and high-quality data from urban driving scenes, we demonstrate its effectiveness by showing that the missing entities may be predicted with high precision (0.87 Hits@1) while significantly outperforming the non-semantic/rule-based baselines.",

    "year": "2022",
    "author": "Wu, Xuan and Zhu, Xinhao and Zhao, Yizheng and Dai, Xinyu",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neural-symbolic computing aims at integrating robust neural learning and sound symbolic reasoning into a single framework, so as to leverage the complementary strengths of both of these, seemingly unrelated (maybe even contradictory) AI paradigms. The central challenge in neural-symbolic computing is to unify the formulation of neural learning and symbolic reasoning into a single framework with common semantics, that is, to seek a joint representation between a neural model and a logical theory that can support the basic grounding learned by the neural model and also stick to the semantics of the logical theory. In this paper, we propose differentiable fuzzy \\(\\mathcal{ALC}\\) (DF-\\(\\mathcal{ALC}\\)) for this role, as a neural-symbolic representation language with the desired semantics. DF-\\(\\mathcal{ALC}\\) unifies the description logic \\(\\mathcal{ALC}\\) and neural models for symbol grounding; in particular, it infuses an \\(\\mathcal{ALC}\\) knowledge base into neural models through differentiable concept and role embeddings. We define a hierarchical loss to the constraint that the grounding learned by neural models must be semantically consistent with \\(\\mathcal{ALC}\\) knowledge bases. And we find that capturing the semantics in grounding solely by maximizing satisfiability cannot revise grounding rationally. We further define a rule-based loss for DF adapting to symbol grounding problems. The experiment results show that DF-\\(\\mathcal{ALC}\\) with rule-based loss can improve the performance of image object detectors in an unsupervised learning way, even in low-resource situations.",

    "abstract": "With every shift in scientific paradigms comes not only a new way of seeing the world, but as Kunh argues, new tools for seeing [ 13]. Today, generative AI and neuro-symbolic systems show signs of changing how science functions, making it possible to synthesise complex heterogenous data in real time, interleaved with complex and situated workflows. But the new tools are not yet fully formed. To realise the opportunities and meet the challenges posed by the growth of generative AI for science and other knowledge work requires us to look beyond improvements in algorithms. The decision-making landscape for information workers has drastically changed, and the pressing need for analysts and experts to collaborate with AI in complex, high-tempo data environments has never been more evident. To bring strategic focus to these challenges in ways that will enable social, environmental and economic benefits for all, CSIRO's Data61 (the data and digital specialist arm of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation - Australia's na- tional science agency) has established the Immersive AI Research Cluster. The cluster allows more than 30 research scientists and engineers to focus on defining a broad range of scientific disciplines for people to work with and understand the information provided by AI, such as data visualisation, visual analytics, connecting remote people, through immersive technologies like virtual and augmented reality. This workshop paper presents the trending research directions and challenges that emerged from this research cluster, which are closely linked to the scientific domains and illustrated through use cases.",

    "abstract": "Sum-product networks (SPNs) in deep probabilistic models have made great progress in computer vision, robotics, neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence, natural language processing, probabilistic programming languages, and other fields. Compared with probabilistic graphical models and deep probabilistic models, SPNs can balance the tractability and expressive efficiency. In addition, SPNs remain more interpretable than deep neural models. The expressiveness and complexity of SPNs depend on their own structure. Thus, how to design an effective SPN structure learning algorithm that can balance expressiveness and complexity has become a hot research topic in recent years. In this paper, we review SPN structure learning comprehensively, including the motivation of SPN structure learning, a systematic review of related theories, the proper categorization of different SPN structure learning algorithms, several evaluation approaches and some helpful online resources. Moreover, we discuss some open issues and research directions for SPN structure learning. To our knowledge, this is the first survey to focus specifically on SPN structure learning, and we hope to provide useful references for researchers in related fields.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Everolimus-based therapy and endocrine monotherapy are used among postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 negative (HR+/HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (mBC) whose disease progressed or recurred on a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI). However, limited evidence exists regarding the real-world comparative effectiveness of these agents. METHODS: This retrospective chart review examined postmenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC patients in community-based oncology practices who received everolimus-based therapy or endocrine monotherapy (index therapy) as any line of therapy for mBC between 1 July 2012 and 15 April 2013 after NSAI failure. Time on treatment (TOT), progression-free survival (PFS), and time to chemotherapy (TTC) from index therapy initiation were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 243 and 270 patients received everolimus-based therapy or endocrine monotherapy in a quota-based sample. Patients treated with everolimus-based therapy had a higher proportion of visceral metastases, high tumor burden, and use of prior chemotherapies for mBC. After adjusting for baseline characteristics, everolimus-based therapy was associated with significantly longer TOT (HR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51-0.87) and PFS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.57-0.98) than endocrine monotherapy. No significant difference was found between everolimus-based therapy and endocrine monotherapy in TTC (HR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.52-1.27). Results stratified by line of therapy were generally consistent with the overall results. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include recall and information bias with potentially absent or erroneous chart data, unobserved factors due to non-randomization, inability to measure outcome assessments paired with measuring outcomes prior to exposures, and potential patient selection bias associated with chart review. CONCLUSIONS: Among a nationwide sample of postmenopausal HR+/HER2- mBC patients treated in community oncology settings, treatment with everolimus-based therapy was associated with significantly longer TOT and PFS compared to endocrine monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Fulvestrant 500 mg and exemestane are widely used agents in first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (ER(+)) postmenopausal MBC after failure of adjuvant nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) treatment. Although fulvestrant 250 mg had similar efficacy compared with exemestane (Evaluation of Faslodex versus Exemestane Clinical Trial study) and fulvestrant 500 mg was superior to fulvestrant 250 mg (Comparison of FASLODEX In Recurrent or Metastatic Breast Cancer study), no direct comparison between fulvestrant 500 mg and exemestane has been conducted. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant 500 mg and exemestane in daily practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of all patients with ER(+) HER2(-) MBC who received fulvestrant 500 mg or exemestane 25 mg as first-line therapy for MBC from 2015 to 2017 in 4 institutions. A total of 120 patients were available for analysis. Both agents accounted for 50% (60) patients. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival (PFS) of the fulvestrant group was significantly longer than that in the exemestane group (6.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.0-7.4] versus 4.8 months [95% CI, 3.0-6.7], P = .024). In subgroup analysis, for patients with visceral metastasis or primary endocrine resistance, no significant difference considering PFS was observed in the 2 groups (P = .563 and .769). No significant difference of Grade 3/4 adverse events was observed in the 2 groups (3 patients, 5% versus 2 patients, 3.3%; P = .648). CONCLUSION: Fulvestrant 500 mg showed better efficacy than exemestane in first-line therapy for MBC of ER(+) postmenopausal women after failure of adjuvant NSAI treatment. For patients with visceral metastasis or primary endocrine resistance, both treatments showed poor outcomes, indicating a need for further alternatives (targeted therapy or chemotherapy). Both agents were well tolerated in terms of toxicities.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced machine learning research including natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, etc., yet they still exhibit critical limitations in reasoning, factual consistency, and interpretability. In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm - Modular Machine Learning (MML) - as an essential approach toward new-generation LLMs. MML decomposes the complex structure of LLMs into three interdependent components: modular representation, modular model, and modular reasoning, aiming to enhance LLMs' capability of counterfactual reasoning, mitigating hallucinations, as well as promoting fairness, safety, and transparency. Specifically, the proposed MML paradigm can: i) clarify the internal working mechanism of LLMs through the disentanglement of semantic components; ii) allow for flexible and task-adaptive model design; iii) enable interpretable and logic-driven decision-making process. We present a feasible implementation of MML-based LLMs via leveraging advanced techniques such as disentangled representation learning, neural architecture search and neuro-symbolic learning. We critically identify key challenges, such as the integration of continuous neural and discrete symbolic processes, joint optimization, and computational scalability, present promising future research directions that deserve further exploration. Ultimately, the integration of the MML paradigm with LLMs has the potential to bridge the gap between statistical (deep) learning and formal (logical) reasoning, thereby paving the way for robust, adaptable, and trustworthy AI systems across a wide range of real-world applications.",

    "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic AI is an effective method for improving the overall performance of AI models by combining the advantages of neural networks and symbolic learning. However, there are differences between the two in terms of how they process data, primarily because they often use different data representation methods, which is often an important factor limiting the overall performance of the two. From this perspective, we analyzed 191 studies from 2013 by constructing a four-level classification framework. The first level defines five types of representation spaces, and the second level focuses on five types of information modalities that the representation space can represent. Then, the third level describes four symbolic logic methods. Finally, the fourth-level categories propose three collaboration strategies between neural networks and symbolic learning. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed analysis of 46 research based on their representation space.",

Although neuro-symbolic AI hopes to enhance the overall explainability by leveraging the transparency of symbolic learning, the results are less evident than imagined. This article proposes a classification for explainability by considering both model design and behavior of 191 studies from 2013, focusing on neuro-symbolic AI, hoping to inspire scholars who want to understand the explainability of neuro-symbolic AI. Precisely, we classify them into five categories by considering whether the form of bridging the representation differences is readable as their design factor, if there are representation differences between neural networks and symbolic logic learning, and whether a model decision or prediction process is understandable as their behavior factor: implicit intermediate representations and implicit prediction, partially explicit intermediate representations and partially explicit prediction, explicit intermediate representations or explicit prediction, explicit intermediate representation and explicit prediction, unified representation and explicit prediction. We also analyzed the research trends and three significant challenges: unified representations, explainability and transparency, and sufficient cooperation from neural networks and symbolic learning. Finally, we put forward suggestions for future research in three aspects: unified representations, enhancing model explainability, ethical considerations, and social impact.",

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) from videos is a challenging, data intensive task. There have been significant strides in recent years, but even state-of-the-art (SoTA) models rely heavily on domain specific supervised fine-tuning of visual features, and even with this data- and compute-intensive fine-tuning, overall performance can still be limited. We argue that the next generation of HAR models could benefit from explicit neuro-symbolic mechanisms in order to flexibly exploit rich contextual information available in, and for, videos. With a view to this, we propose a Human Activity Recognition with Context Prompt (HARCP) task to investigate the value of contextual information for video-based HAR. We also present a neuro-symbolic graph neural network-based framework that integrates zero-shot object localisation to address the HARCP task. This captures the human activity as a sequence of graph-based scene representations relating parts of the human body to key objects, supporting the targeted injection of external contextual knowledge in symbolic form. We evaluate existing HAR baselines alongside our graph-based methods to demonstrate the advantage of being able to accommodate this additional channel of information. Our evaluations show that not only does context information from key objects boost accuracy beyond that provided by SoTA HAR models alone, there is also a greater semantic similarity between our model's errors and the target class. We argue that this represents an improved model alignment with human-like errors and quantify this with a novel measure we call Semantic Prediction Dispersion.",

We hypothesize that when a system makes a deduction that was, in some way, unexpected by the user then locating the source of the disagreement or misunderstanding is best achieved through a collaborative dialogue process that allows the participants to gradually isolate the cause.

Comprising a 'neuro' component for feature extraction and a 'symbolic' component for decision-making, neuro-symbolic AI has yet to fully benefit from efficient hardware accelerators. Additionally, current hardware struggles to accommodate applications requiring dynamic resource allocation between these two components. To address these challenges-and mitigate the typical data-transfer bottleneck of classical Von Neumann architectures-we propose a ferroelectric charge-domain compute-in-memory (CiM) array as the foundational processing element for neuro-symbolic AI. This array seamlessly handles both the critical multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations of the 'neuro' workload and the parallel associative search operations of the 'symbolic' workload. To enable this approach, we introduce an innovative 1FeFET-1C cell, combining a ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) with a capacitor. This design, overcomes the destructive sensing limitations of DRAM in CiM applications, while capable of capitalizing decades of DRAM expertise with a similar cell structure as DRAM, achieves high immunity against FeFET variation-crucial for neuro-symbolic AI-and demonstrates superior energy efficiency. The functionalities of our design have been successfully validated through SPICE simulations and prototype fabrication and testing. Our hardware platform has been benchmarked in executing typical neuro-symbolic AI reasoning tasks, showing over 2x improvement in latency and 1000x improvement in energy efficiency compared to GPU-based implementations.",

    "abstract": "The effects of non-steroid antiinflammatory (NSAI) drugs on the rectal membrane were studied by measuring the change in the rectal absorption of ampicillin and cephalothin. All the NSAI drugs studied the rectal absorption of antibiotics which were not able to permeate readily through the rectal membrane in the absence of NSAI drugs. The optimum concentrations of NSAI drugs as adjuvants in triglyceride suppositories containing 10% ampicillin sodium were 1.5% for indomethacin sodium and diclofenac sodium, 5% for mepirizole, 7.5% for phenylbutazone and 10% for sodium salicylate. These concentrations of NSAI drugs were used in a study of the promoting efficacy of the drugs as adjuvants for the rectal absorption of antibiotics. The promoting efects of adjuvants in dogs were inferior to those in rabbits. In simultaneous measurements of NSAI drugs and antibiotic, the absorption of antibiotic started at the early stages after the administration of suppositories and the peak blood level was reached while the blood concentration of NSAI drug was still increasing. Evidently, the NSAI drugs made the mucosal barrier leaky to H2O-soluble antibiotics at the early stages of permeation of the NSAI drugs through the rectal membrane, and the barrier rapidly recovered its normal properties even while the permeation of NSAI drug was continuing and a considerable amount of antibiotic still remained in the rectal cavity. A linear correlation between the enhanced absorption of antibiotics and the antiinflammatory activity of NSAI drugs against carrageenan-induced edema was observed.",

    "abstract": "In this paper a framework of the heterogeneous system for an adaptive classification of multivariate numerical data is proposed. Considered data characterize the dynamics of the simulated responses of auditory nerve fibers as probability that represents the average of the ensemble for acoustic signals. The possibility to classify sound stimuli by means of analysis of the responses of the auditory nerve for the fibers with high and low spontaneous rates is examined. The aim of the study was to develop and implement a method for an adaptive pattern recognition in limited a priori information about their number and structure. The proposed model architecture consists of several units that generalize basic stages of a perceptual process that in turn corresponds neuro-symbolic information processing approach to the machine perception problem. Proposed method combines the advantages of the self-organizing maps and the radial basic function networks. This combination leads to a hybrid learning approach, which allow to provide the automatic classification of unlabeled data. According to the obtained results, the proposed approach showed better accuracy for several complex benchmark tests as well as for pure tones recognition by means of simulated auditory nerve fibers responses compared to k-means and single-linkage unsupervised classification strategies.",

    "abstract": "Plantar heel pain, a chronic and disabling foot alignment, occurs in the adult population. Extracorporal shock wave therapy (ESWT) offers a nonsurgical option in addition to stretching exercises, heel cups, NSAI, and corticosteroid injections. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ESWT on calcaneal bone spurs and the correlation between clinical outcomes and radiologic changes. The study involved 108 patients with heel pain and radiologically diagnosed heel spurs. All patients underwent ESWT once a week for 5 weeks at the clinic. Each patient received 2,000 impulses of shock waves, starting with 0.05 mJ/mm2 (1.8 bar) and increasing to 0.4 mJ/mm2 (4.0 bar). Standard radiographies of the affected heels were obtained before and after the therapy. Clinical results demonstrated excellent (no pain) in 66.7% of the cases, good (50% of pain reduced) in 15.7% of the cases, and unsatisfactory (no reduction in pain) in 17.6%. After five ESWT treatments, no patients who received shock wave applications had significant spur reductions, but 19 patients (17.6%) had a decrease in the angle of the spur, 23 patients (21.3%) had a decrease in the dimensions of the spur, and one patient had a broken spur. Therefore, results showed no correlation between clinical outcome and radiologic changes. The present study supports the finding that even with no radiologic change after ESWT therapy, the therapy produces significant effects in reducing patients' complaints about heel spurs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: After the failure of a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (nsAI) for postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC), it is unclear which of various kinds of endocrine therapy is the most appropriate. A randomized controlled trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of daily toremifene 120 mg (TOR120), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, and exemestane 25 mg (EXE), a steroidal aromatase inhibitor. The primary end point was the clinical benefit rate (CBR). The secondary end points were objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity. METHODS: Initially, a total of 91 women was registered in the study and randomly assigned to either TOR120 (n = 46) or EXE (n = 45) from October 2008 to November 2011. Three of the 46 patients in the TOR120 arm were not received treatment, 2 patients having withdrawn from the trial by their preference and one having been dropped due to administration of another SERM. RESULTS: When analyzed after a median observation period of 16.9 months, the intention-to-treat analysis showed that there were no statistical difference between TOR120 (N = 46) and EXE (n = 45) in terms of CBR (41.3% vs. 26.7%; P = 0.14), ORR (10.8% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.083), and OS (Hazard ratio, 0.60; P = 0.22). The PFS of TOR120 was longer than that of EXE, the difference being statistically significant (Hazard ratio, 0.61, P = 0.045). The results in treatment-received cohort (N = 88) were similar to those in ITT cohort. Both treatments were well-tolerated with no severe adverse events, although the treatment of 3 of 43 women administered TOR120 was stopped after a few days because of nausea, general fatigue, hot flush and night sweating. CONCLUSIONS: TOR120, as a subsequent endocrine therapy for mBC patients who failed non-steroidal AI treatment, could potentially be more beneficial than EXE.

    "abstract": "In this work, we develop a novel neuro-symbolic model for automated seizure detection using multi-views of data representation. Firstly, the spectral and line length features are extracted using a multi-view feature extraction technique. Next, a signal temporal logic neural network (STONE) that combines the benefits of neural networks and temporal logics is constructed to classify the seizure and nonseizure data. STONE is designed in such a way that each neuron has a symbolic representation corresponding to a component in a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) formula. Compared with traditional STL inference algorithms, STONE is end-to-end differentiable such that the learning can be accomplished through back-propagation. In addition, STONE improves the interpretability of seizure detection models as the outcome of STONE is a wSTL formula that is interpretable and human-readable. Importantly, the wSTL formula reveals the reasoning behind seizure as a description of the evolution of EEG signals. STONE is tested on two popular EEG databases and demonstrated to achieve promising detection performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when compared with existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, STONE can provide a humanreadable formula as a description of the seizure characteristics, and the formula is also visualizable for easy interpretation of the classifier, which is a missing property in existing seizure detection methods.",

    "abstract": "Class Incremental Learning (CIL) is a paradigm that excels in efficiently training models on an expanding set of classes, while preserving performance in classes learned earlier. In the context of smart city development, CIL plays a crucial role in addressing the need for Networking Systems of Artificial Intelligence (NSAI) to continuously adapt to ever -evolving data. In recent years, the incremental network structure widely adopted in CIL suffers from poor knowledge distillation and rapid model parameter growth. In this paper, we introduce a novel strategy named dynamic regeneration with task -adaptive distillation (DRTAD), which dynamically adapts to new tasks, and sustains good performance even as the class set continues to grow. DRTAD adopts a two -stage training strategy: dynamic regeneration and dynamic retention. During dynamic regeneration, DRTAD enhances feature representation by creating a new feature extraction module that extracts features from new classes, while also utilizing features from previously learned classes. Additionally, DRTAD introduces task -adaptive distillation to improve the poor knowledge distillation, further mitigating catastrophic forgetting. During the dynamic retention phase, DRTAD achieves a higher pruning rate through RM operation. Comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-100 datasets demonstrate DRTAD's superior performance compared to existing CIL methods. Notably, in the CIFAR100-B50 5 steps incremental setting, DRTAD increases the lastphase accuracy from 65.51% to 70.54% (+5.03%), while maintaining fewer parameters (-11.1%). Similarly, in the ImageNet100-B50 10 steps setting, the last -phase accuracy rises from 70.04% to 72.50% (+2.46%). These results indicate DRTAD's efficacy in mitigating catastrophic forgetting in incremental structure.",

    "abstract": "Humans leverage compositionality to efficiently learn new concepts, understanding how familiar parts can combine together to form novel objects. In contrast, popular computer vision models struggle to make the same types of inferences, requiring more data and generalizing less flexibly than people do. Here, we study these distinctively human abilities across a range of different types of visual composition, examining how people classify and generate ``alien figures'' with rich relational structure. We also develop a Bayesian program induction model which searches for the best programs for generating the candidate visual figures, utilizing a large program space containing different compositional mechanisms and abstractions. In few shot classification tasks, we find that people and the program induction model can make a range of meaningful compositional generalizations, with the model providing a strong account of the experimental data as well as interpretable parameters that reveal human assumptions about the factors invariant to category membership (here, to rotation and changing part attachment). In few shot generation tasks, both people and the models are able to construct compelling novel examples, with people behaving in additional structured ways beyond the model capabilities, e.g. making choices that complete a set or reconfiguring existing parts in highly novel ways. To capture these additional behavioral patterns, we develop an alternative model based on neuro-symbolic program induction: this model also composes new concepts from existing parts yet, distinctively, it utilizes neural network modules to successfully capture residual statistical structure. Together, our behavioral and computational findings show how people and models can produce a rich variety of compositional behavior when classifying and generating visual objects.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) approach to agent development has formed the basis for much of the research on architectures for autonomous agents. A key advantage of the BDI approach is that agents may pursue multiple intentions in parallel. However, previous approaches to managing possible interactions between concurrently executing intentions are limited to interactions between simple achievement goals (and in some cases maintenance goals). In this paper, we present a new approach to intention progression for agents with temporally extended goals which allow mixing reachability and invariant properties, e.g., ``travel to location A while not exceeding a gradient of 5% '' . Temporally extended goals may be specified at run-time (top-level goals), and as subgoals in plans. In addition, our approach allows human-authored plans and plans implemented as reinforcement learning policies to be freely mixed in an agent program, allowing the development of agents with `neurosymbolic' architectures.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Effective treatments for hormone-receptor-positive (HR(+)) breast cancer (BC) following relapse/progression on nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) therapy are needed. Initial Breast Cancer Trials of OraL EveROlimus-2 (BOLERO-2) trial data demonstrated that everolimus and exemestane significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus exemestane alone in this patient population. METHODS: BOLERO-2 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, international trial comparing everolimus (10 mg/day) plus exemestane (25 mg/day) versus placebo plus exemestane in postmenopausal women with HR(+) advanced BC with recurrence/progression during or after NSAIs. The primary endpoint was PFS by local investigator review, and was confirmed by independent central radiology review. Overall survival, response rate, and clinical benefit rate were secondary endpoints. RESULTS: Final study results with median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane [investigator review: 7.8 versus 3.2 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.54); log-rank P < 0.0001; central review: 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.31-0.48); log-rank P < 0.0001] in the overall population and in all prospectively defined subgroups, including patients with visceral metastases, [corrected] and irrespective of age. The incidence and severity of adverse events were consistent with those reported at the interim analysis and in other everolimus trials. CONCLUSION: The addition of everolimus to exemestane markedly prolonged PFS in patients with HR(+) advanced BC with disease recurrence/progression following prior NSAIs. These results further support the use of everolimus plus exemestane in this patient population. ClinicalTrials.gov #NCT00863655.",

    "abstract": "The spatial distribution characteristics of iron ore components are important when measuring the difficulty of their beneficiation. Polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy are traditional methods with some shortcomings, including complicated operation and low efficiency. Most of the laboratory hyperspectral imaging techniques that have emerged in recent years have been focused on the field of mineral resource exploration. In contrast, the mineral distribution and tectonic characteristics of iron ores have been relatively poorly studied in the field of beneficiation. To address the issue, 11 experimental samples of banded iron formation (BIF)-hosted iron ores were selected and tested using an imaging spectrometer. Then, based on the differences in spectral characteristic of the three main components (quartz, hematite, and magnetite) in the samples, the identification model of the spatial distribution of the iron ore components was established using the normalized spectral amplitude index (NSAI) and spectral angle mapper (SAM). The NSAI and SAM identify minerals based on spectral amplitude features and spectral morphological features of the sample, respectively. The spatial distribution of different minerals in the samples was tested using the model, and the test results demonstrated that the spatial distribution of the three components is consistent with the banded tectonic character of the sample. Upon comparison with the chemical test results, the mean absolute errors (MAE) of the model for quartz, hematite, and magnetite in the samples were 2.03%, 1.34%, and 1.55%, respectively, and the root mean square errors (RMSE) were 2.72%, 2.08%, and 1.85%, respectively, with the exception of one martite sample that reached an MAE of 10.17%. Therefore, the model demonstrates a high degree of accuracy. The research provides a new method to test the spatial distribution of iron ore components.",

On the other hand, these reasoning tasks are usually presumed to be more approachable for symbolic programming. To understand the mechanism of reasoning of LMs, we curate synthetic datasets containing equivalent (natural, symbolic) data pairs, where symbolic examples contain first-order logic rules and predicates from non-parametric knowledge bases (KBs), supporting automated verification of intermediate reasoning results. Then we revisit neuro-symbolic approaches and propose to learn from demonstrations containing logic rules and corresponding examples to iteratively reason over KBs, recovering Prolog's backward chaining algorithm and supporting automated verification of LMs' outputs. Comprehensive experiments are included to systematically compare LMLP with CoT in deductive reasoning settings, showing that LMLP enjoys more than 25% higher accuracy than CoT on length generalization benchmarks even with smaller model sizes.",

Our algorithm offers a joint framework of neuro-symbolic task planning and low-level motion generation conditioned on the specified goal. At the core of our approach is a two-level scene graph representation, namely geometric scene graph and symbolic scene graph. This hierarchical representation serves as a structured, object-centric abstraction of manipulation scenes. Our model uses graph neural networks to process these scene graphs for predicting high-level task plans and low-level motions. We demonstrate that our method scales to long-horizon tasks and generalizes well to novel task goals. We validate our method in a kitchen storage task in both physical simulation and the real world. Our experiments show that our method achieved over 70% success rate and nearly 90% of subgoal completion rate on the real robot while being four orders of magnitude faster in computation time compared to standard search-based task-and-motion planner.",

This perspective article examines the recent advances at the intersection of LLMs, intelligent agents, and scientific computation, with a focus on biophysical computation. Building on these advancements, we introduce ADAM (Agent for Digital Atoms and Molecules), an innovative multi-agent LLM-based framework. ADAM employs cutting-edge AI architectures to reshape scientific workflows through a modular design. It adopts a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture that combines LLM-driven semantic tools with deterministic symbolic computations. Moreover, its ADAM Tool Protocol (ATP) enables asynchronous, database-centric tool orchestration, fostering community-driven extensibility. Despite the significant progress made, ongoing challenges call for further efforts in establishing benchmarking standards, optimizing foundational models and agents, and building an open collaborative ecosystem.

    "abstract": "The frequent use of anti-inflammatory drugs and the side effects of existing drugs keep the need for new compounds constant. For this purpose, flurbiprofen and ibuprofen-like compounds, which are frequently used anti-inflammatory compounds in this study, were synthesized and their structures were elucidated. Like ibuprofen and flurbiprofen, the compounds contain a residue of phenylacetic acid. On the other hand, it contains a secondary amine residue. Thus, it is planned to reduce the acidity, which is the biggest side effect of NSAI drugs, even a little bit. The estimated ADME parameters of the compounds were evaluated. Apart from internal use, local use of anti-inflammatory compounds is also very important. For this reason, the skin permeability values of the compounds were also calculated. And it has been found to be compatible with reference drugs. The COX enzyme inhibitory effects of the obtained compounds were tested by in vitro experiments. Compound 2a showed significant activity against COX-1 enzyme with an IC(50) = 0.123 + 0.005 μM. The interaction of the compound with the enzyme active site was clarified by molecular dynamics studies.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve (MACN) neuropathy is reported to be caused by iatrogenic reasons. Although the cases describing the posterior branch of MACN neuropathy are abundant, only one case caused by lipoma has been found to describe the anterior branch of MACN neuropathy in the literature. As for the reason for the forearm pain, we report the only case describing isolated anterior branch of MACN neuropathy which has developed due to repeated minor trauma. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 37-year-old woman patient with pain in her medial forearm and elbow following the shaking of a rug. Pain and symptoms of dysestesia in the distribution of the right MACN were found. Electrophysiological examination confirmed the normality of the main nerve trunks of the right upper limb and demonstrated abnormalities of the right MACN when compared with the left side. Sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude on the right anterior branch of the MACN was detected to be lower in proportion to the left. In the light of these findings, NSAI drug and physical therapy was performed. Dysestesia and pain were relieved and no recurrence was observed after a follow-up of 14 months. CONCLUSION: MACN neuropathy should be taken into account for the differential diagnosis of the patients with complaints of pain and dysestesia in medial forearm and anteromedial aspect of the elbow.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the sustained evolution of misinformation that aims at manipulating public opinions. Unlike traditional rumors or fake news editors who mainly rely on generated and/or counterfeited images, text and videos, current misinformation creators now more tend to use out-of-context multimedia contents (e.g. mismatched images and captions) to deceive the public and fake news detection systems. This new type of misinformation increases the difficulty of not only detection but also clarification, because every individual modality is close enough to true information. To address this challenge, in this paper we explore how to achieve interpretable cross-modal de-contextualization detection that simultaneously identifies the mismatched pairs and the cross-modal contradictions, which is helpful for fact-check websites to document clarifications. The proposed model first symbolically disassembles the text-modality information to a set of fact queries based on the Abstract Meaning Representation of the caption and then forwards the query-image pairs into a pre-trained large vision-language model select the ``evidences that are helpful for us to detect misinformation. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed methodology can provide us with much more interpretable predictions while maintaining the accuracy same as the state-of-the-art model on this task.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rising number of patients with dementia has become a serious social problem worldwide. To help detect dementia at an early stage, many studies have been conducted to detect signs of cognitive decline by prosodic and acoustic features. However, many of these methods are not suitable for everyday use as they focus on cognitive function or conversational speech during the examinations. In contrast, conversational humanoid robots are expected to be used in the care of older people to help reduce the work of care and monitoring through interaction. OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) through conversations between patients and humanoid robots without a specific examination, such as neuropsychological examination. METHODS: This was an exploratory study involving patients with MCI and cognitively normal (CN) older people. We collected the conversation data during neuropsychological examination (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE]) and everyday conversation between a humanoid robot and 94 participants (n=47, 50%, patients with MCI and n=47, 50%, CN older people). We extracted 17 types of prosodic and acoustic features, such as the duration of response time and jitter, from these conversations. We conducted a statistical significance test for each feature to clarify the speech features that are useful when classifying people into CN people and patients with MCI. Furthermore, we conducted an automatic classification experiment using a support vector machine (SVM) to verify whether it is possible to automatically classify these 2 groups by the features identified in the statistical significance test. RESULTS: We obtained significant differences in 5 (29%) of 17 types of features obtained from the MMSE conversational speech. The duration of response time, the duration of silent periods, and the proportion of silent periods showed a significant difference (P<.001) and met the reference value r=0.1 (small) of the effect size. Additionally, filler periods (P<.01) and the proportion of fillers (P=.02) showed a significant difference; however, these did not meet the reference value of the effect size. In contrast, we obtained significant differences in 16 (94%) of 17 types of features obtained from the everyday conversations with the humanoid robot. The duration of response time, the duration of speech periods, jitter (local, relative average perturbation [rap], 5-point period perturbation quotient [ppq5], difference of difference of periods [ddp]), shimmer (local, amplitude perturbation quotient [apq]3, apq5, apq11, average absolute differences between the amplitudes of consecutive periods [dda]), and F0cov (coefficient of variation of the fundamental frequency) showed a significant difference (P<.001). In addition, the duration of response time, the duration of silent periods, the filler period, and the proportion of fillers showed significant differences (P<.05). However, only jitter (local) met the reference value r=0.1 (small) of the effect size. In the automatic classification experiment for the classification of participants into CN and MCI groups, the results showed 66.0% accuracy in the MMSE conversational speech and 68.1% accuracy in everyday conversations with the humanoid robot. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the possibility of early and simple screening for patients with MCI using prosodic and acoustic features from everyday conversations with a humanoid robot with the same level of accuracy as the MMSE.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neural networks, as currently designed, fall short of achieving true logical intelligence. Modern AI models rely on standard neural computation-inner-product-based transformations and nonlinear activations-to approximate patterns from data. While effective for inductive learning, this architecture lacks the structural guarantees necessary for deductive inference and logical consistency. As a result, deep networks struggle with rule-based reasoning, structured generalization, and interpretability without extensive post-hoc modifications. This position paper argues that standard neural layers must be fundamentally rethought to integrate logical reasoning. We advocate for Logical Neural Units (LNUs)-modular components that embed differentiable approximations of logical operations (e.g., AND, OR, NOT) directly within neural architectures. We critique existing neurosymbolic approaches, highlight the limitations of standard neural computation for logical inference, and present LNUs as a necessary paradigm shift in AI. Finally, we outline a roadmap for implementation, discussing theoretical foundations, architectural integration, and key challenges for future research.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has made remarkable achievements in various applications in recent years. With the increasing computing power and the \"black box\" problem of neural networks, however, the development of deep neural networks (DNNs) has entered a bottleneck period. This article proposes a novel deep belief network (DBN) based on knowledge transfer and optimization of the network structure. First, a neural-symbolic model is proposed to extract rules to describe the dynamic operation mechanism of the deep network. Second, knowledge fusion is proposed based on the merge and deletion of the extracted rules from the DBN model. Finally, a new DNN, knowledge transfer-based sparse DBN (KT-SDBN) is constructed to generate a sparse network without excessive information loss. In comparison with DBN, KT-SDBN has a more sparse network structure and better learning performance on the existing knowledge and data. The experimental results in the benchmark data indicate that KT-SDBN not only has effective feature learning performance with 30% of the original network parameters but also shows a large compression rate that is far larger than other structure optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Do vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained to caption an image of a durian learn visual concepts such as brown (color) and spiky (texture) at the same time? We aim to answer this question as visual concepts learned for free would enable wide applications such as neuro-symbolic reasoning or human-interpretable object classification. We assume that the visual concepts, if captured by pre-trained VLMs, can be extracted by their vision-language interface with text-based concept prompts. We observe that recent works prompting VLMs with concepts often differ in their strategies to define and evaluate the visual concepts, leading to conflicting conclusions. We propose a new concept definition strategy based on two observations: First, certain concept prompts include shortcuts that recognize correct concepts for wrong reasons; Second, multimodal information (e.g. visual discriminativeness, and textual knowledge) should be leveraged when selecting the concepts. Our proposed concept discovery and learning (CDL) framework is thus designed to identify a diverse list of generic visual concepts (e.g. spiky as opposed to spiky durian ), which are ranked and selected based on visual and language mutual information. We carefully design quantitative and human evaluations of the discovered concepts on six diverse visual recognition datasets, which confirm that pre-trained VLMs do learn visual concepts that provide accurate and thorough descriptions for the recognized objects. All code and models are publicly released.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose nsDB, a novel neuro-symbolic database system that integrates neural and symbolic system architectures natively to address the weaknesses of each, providing a strong database capable of data managing, model learning, and complex analytical query processing over multi-modal data. We employ a real-world NBA data analytical query as an example to illustrate the functionality of each component in nsDB and highlight the research challenges to build it. We then present the key design principles and our preliminary attempts to address them. In a nutshell, we envision that the next generation database system nsDB integrates the complex neural system with the simple symbolic system. Undoubtedly, nsDB will serve as a bridge between databases with AI models, which abstracts away the AI complexities but allows end users to enjoy the strong capabilities of them. We are in the early stages of the journey to build nsDB, there are many opening challenges, e.g., in-database model training, multi-objective query optimization, and database agent development. We hope the researchers from different communities (e.g., system, architecture, database, artificial intelligence) could tackle them together.",

We present a comprehensive approach to optimize UAV-based search and rescue operations in neighborhood areas, utilizing both a 3D AirSim-ROS2 simulator and a 2D simulator. The path planning problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and we propose a novel ``Shrinking POMCP'' approach to address time constraints. In the AirSim environment, we integrate our approach with a probabilistic world model for belief maintenance and a neurosymbolic navigator for obstacle avoidance. The 2D simulator employs surrogate ROS2 nodes with equivalent functionality. We compare trajectories generated by different approaches in the 2D simulator and evaluate performance across various belief types in the 3D AirSim-ROS simulator. Experimental results from both simulators demonstrate that our proposed shrinking POMCP solution achieves significant improvements in search times compared to alternative methods, showcasing its potential for enhancing the efficiency of UAV-assisted search and rescue operations.",

Unlike previous methods, this grammar maintains completeness while minimizing redundancy. Based on this, QCompiler includes a Query Expression Translator, a Lexical Syntax Parser, and a Recursive Descent Processor to compile queries into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for execution. The atomicity of the sub-queries in the leaf nodes ensures more precise document retrieval and response generation, significantly improving the RAG system's ability to address complex queries.",

    "abstract": "Programs, consisting of semantic and structural information, play an important role in the communication between humans and agents. Towards learning general program executors to unify perception, reasoning, and decision making, we formulate program-guided tasks which require learning to execute a given program on the observed task specification. Furthermore, we propose the Program-guided Transformer (ProTo), which integrates both semantic and structural guidance of a program by leveraging cross-attention and masked self-attention to pass messages between the specification and routines in the program. ProTo executes a program in a learned latent space and enjoys stronger representation ability than previous neural-symbolic approaches. We demonstrate that ProTo significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on GQA visual reasoning and 2D Minecraft policy learning datasets. Additionally, ProTo demonstrates better generalization to unseen, complex, and human-written programs.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) patients face abnormal lipid metabolism and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk due to endocrine therapies (ETs). This study evaluates CVD incidence and lipid abnormalities in Chinese patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive (HR+) BC to inform personalized treatments. METHODS: Data from female patients aged 18-80 years with stage I-III HR + BC registered in the National Cancer Center Oncology Information Database (NCCOID) (2013-2018) were analyzed. Outcomes included lipid profile changes, CVD incidence, and five-year survival rates. RESULTS: Among 11,537 patients, ETs significantly disrupted lipid metabolism, increasing abnormal total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels. Nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (NSAI) ± ovarian function suppression (OFS) led to the largest increase in abnormal total cholesterol (10.26 to 17.32%), while selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) ± OFS caused the greatest rises in triglycerides (16.07 to 25.86%), LDL-C (12.11 to 23.34%), and HDL-C (10.86 to 17.23%). Only 3.82% of patients received lipid-lowering therapy. ETs were associated with higher CVD incidence, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation, but five-year survival rates did not differ significantly across ET regimens (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: ETs may be associated with alterations in lipid metabolism and a potential increase in CVD risk in early-stage HR + BC patients. These findings highlight the relevance of enhanced lipid monitoring and cardiovascular risk management to support optimized treatment outcomes in the Chinese population.",

    "abstract": "(1) Background: This study aimed to conduct a NMA and CEA combined study to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different CDK4/6 inhibitors (Abem, Palbo, and Ribo) plus NSAI with placebo plus NSAI in the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- ABC from the perspective of payers in China. (2) Methods: Studies which evaluated CDK4/6 inhibitors plus NSAI for HR+/HER2- ABC were searched. A Bayesian NMA was carried out and the main outcomes were the hazard ratios (HRs) of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The costs and efficacy of first-line therapies for HR+/HER2- ABC were evaluated using the Markov model. The main outcomes in the CEA were incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs), incremental monetary benefit (INMB), and incremental net-health benefit (INHB). The robustness of the model was assessed by one-way, three-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Then, we further simulated the impact of different prices of CDK4/6 inhibitors on the results. (3) Results: Seven studies involving 5347 patients were included in the NMA. The three first-line CDK4/6 inhibitors plus NSAI groups provided significant PFS and OS superiority to NSAI alone. Abem + NSAI represented a significant statistical advantage onPFS (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.90, p = 0.009) and indicated a trend of being the best OS benefit compared to the placebo + NSAI group (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72-1.08). The Abem + NSAI, Palbo + NSAI, and Ribo + NSAI groups resulted in additional costs of 12,602, 20,391, and 81,258, with additional effects of 0.38, 0.31, and 0.30 QALYs, respectively, leading to an ICUR of 33,163/QALY, 65,777/QALY, and 270,860/QALY. Additional pairwise comparisons showed that Abem + NSAI was the only cost-effective option in three CDK4/6 inhibitors plus NSAI groups at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 38,029/QALY. The sensitivity analyses showed that the proportion of receiving subsequent CDK4/6 inhibitors and the cost of Abem significantly influenced the results of Abem + NSAI compared with placebo + NSAI. (4) Conclusion: From the perspective of Chinese payers, Abem + NSAI was a cost-effective treatment option compared with placebo + NSAI at the WTP of 38,029/QALY, since only the ICUR of 33,163/QALY of Abem + NSAI was lower than the WTP of 38,029/QALY in China (2022). The Palbo + NSAI and Ribo + NSAI groups were not cost-effective unless drug prices were adjusted to 50% or 10% of current prices (320.67 per cycle or 264.60 per cycle). (5) Others: We have prospectively registered the study with the PROSPERO, and the PROSPERO registration number is CRD42023399342.",

    "abstract": "Security and risk assessment aims to prioritize detected vulnerabilities for remediation in a computer networking system. The widely used expert-based risk prioritization approach, e.g., Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), cannot realistically associate vulnerabilities to the likelihood of exploitation. The CVSS metrics are calculated from static formulas, and cannot easily integrate attackers' motivations and capabilities w.r.t. the network environmental factors. To address this issue, this paper proposes LICALITY, a vulnerability risk prioritization system. LICALITY captures the attacker's preference on exploiting vulnerabilities through a threat modeling method, and learns threat attributes that contribute to the exploitation of vulnerability. LICALITY creatively uses a neuro-symbolic model, with neural network (NN) and probabilistic logic programming (PLP) techniques, to learn such threat attributes. The risk of vulnerability is assessed from the criticality of exploitation and the likelihood of exploitation. LICALITY consolidates these two measurements by using a logic reasoning engine. In the evaluation, the historical threat and future threat are from real attack scenarios. The results reveal that LICALITY reduces the vulnerability remediation work of the future threat required by the CVSS by a factor of 2.89 in the first case study and by a factor of 1.85 in the second case study. Such future threats are identified as the top routinely exploited vulnerabilities and the APT attack chained vulnerabilities reported in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) alerts.",

    "abstract": "Raw behavioral data is becoming increasingly more abundant and more easily obtainable in spatiotemporal domains such as sports, video games, navigation & driving, motion capture, and animal science. How can we best use this data to advance their respective domains forward? For instance, researchers for self-driving vehicles would like to identify the key features of the environment state that impact decision-making the most; game developers would like to populate their games with characters that have unique and diverse behaviors to create a more immersive gaming experience; and behavioral neuroscientists would like to uncover the underlying mechanisms that drive learning in animals. Machine learning, the science of developing models and algorithms to identify and leverage patterns in data, is well-equipped to aid in these endeavors. But how do we integrate machine learning with these spatiotemporal domains in a principled way? In this thesis, we develop and introduce new algorithms in programmatic deep learningthat tackle some of the new challenges encountered in behavior modeling.Our work in programmatic deep learning comprises two main themes: in the first, we show how to use expert-written programs as sources of weak labels in domains where manually-annotated expert labels are scarce; in the second, we explore programs as a flexible function class with human-interpretable structure and show how to learn them via neurosymbolic program learning. Augmenting deep learning with programmatic structure allows domain experts to easily incorporate domain knowledge into machine learning models; we show that this results in significant improvements in many behavior modeling applications like imitation learning, controllable generation, counterfactual analysis, and unsupervised clustering.",

    "abstract": "Based on the unique problems and challenges in the disassembly scenario of waste electric vehicle batteries (EVBs), we propose a knowledge-driven flexible human-robot hybrid disassembly line. The disassembly line can not only split the EVB disassembling tasks layer by layer to the primitive-level subtasks based on knowledge but also intelligently generate the optimal disassembling primitive sequence to complete the disassembling task. To further elaborate on the key technologies of the above-mentioned disassembly line, we focus on the implementation of the high-accuracy screw disassembly and disassembly planning system based on NeuroSymbolic. Implementation of the high-accuracy screw disassembly is realized by a new design of the disassembly actuator, high-accuracy screw position and pose estimation based on visual perception, and robust insertion based on force perception. The disassembly planning system is constructed by defining disassembly primitives and introducing neural predicates which can take the sensor data as input and output the symbolic states. Experiments show that our system can effectively solve the screw disassembling task in complex disassembly scenarios.",

Screw disassembly by robots remains a challenge due to the uncertainties in this task. In this paper, we designed an architecture of NeuroSymbolic task and motion planning, which uses neural predicates to map the sensor into a quasi-symbolic state and schedules action primitives autonomously based on current state and goal state. This architecture guarantees autonomy and explainability which is important in human-robot hybrid disassembly pipeline. In primitive implementation, a customized end-effector, accurate vision-based and force-based pose estimation are enabled to ensure the robustness of the system. The experiment shows that the proposed system can achieve 100% success rate in lab environment. We will deploy and evaluate it in the real factory environment in the future.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in modern machine learning algorithms, the opaqueness of their underlying mechanisms continues to be an obstacle in adoption. To instill confidence and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) systems, explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a response to improve modern machine learning algorithms' explainability. Inductive logic programming (ILP), a subfield of symbolic AI, plays a promising role in generating interpretable explanations because of its intuitive logic-driven framework. ILP effectively leverages abductive reasoning to generate explainable first-order clausal theories from examples and background knowledge. However, several challenges in developing methods inspired by ILP need to be addressed for their successful application in practice. For example, the existing ILP systems often have a vast solution space, and the induced solutions are very sensitive to noises and disturbances. This survey paper summarizes the recent advances in ILP and a discussion of statistical relational learning (SRL) and neural-symbolic algorithms, which offer synergistic views to ILP. Following a critical review of the recent advances, we delineate observed challenges and highlight potential avenues of further ILP-motivated research toward developing self-explanatory AI systems.",

The system significantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of disease detection through an innovative graph attention mechanism and optimized loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that this system significantly outperforms traditional methods across key metrics such as precision, recall, and accuracy, with the graph attention mechanism excelling in all aspects, particularly achieving a precision of 0.94, a recall of 0.92, and an accuracy of 0.93. Furthermore, comparative experiments with various loss functions further validate the effectiveness of the graph attention loss mechanism in enhancing model performance. This research not only advances the application of deep learning in agricultural disease detection theoretically but also provides robust technological tools for disease management and decision support in actual agricultural production, showcasing broad application prospects and profound practical value.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of symbolic and linguistic representations of sensorimotor behavior is a cognitive process performed by an agent when it is executing and/or observing own and others' actions. According to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, these representations develop during the sensorimotor stage and the pre-operational stage. We propose a model that relates the conceptualization of the higher-level information from visual stimuli to the development of ventral/dorsal visual streams. This model employs neural network architecture incorporating a predictive sensory module based on an RNNPB (Recurrent Neural Network with Parametric Biases) and a horizontal product model. We exemplify this model through a robot passively observing an object to learn its features and movements. During the learning process of observing sensorimotor primitives, i.e. observing a set of trajectories of arm movements and its oriented object features, the pre-symbolic representation is self-organized in the parametric units. These representational units act as bifurcation parameters, guiding the robot to recognize and predict various learned sensorimotor primitives. The pre-symbolic representation also accounts for the learning of sensorimotor primitives in a latent learning context.",

    "abstract": "In abstract visual reasoning, monolithic deep learning models suffer from limited interpretability and generalization, while existing neuro-symbolic approaches fall short in capturing the diversity and systematicity of attributes and relation representations. To address these challenges, we propose a Systematic Abductive Reasoning model with diverse relation representations (Rel-SAR) in Vector-symbolic Architecture (VSA) to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM). To derive attribute representations with symbolic reasoning potential, we introduce not only various types of atomic vectors that represent numeric, periodic and logical semantics, but also the structured high-dimentional representation (SHDR) for the overall Grid component. For systematic reasoning, we propose novel numerical and logical relation functions and perform rule abduction and execution in a unified framework that integrates these relation representations. Experimental results demonstrate that Rel-SAR achieves significant improvement on RPM tasks and exhibits robust out-of-distribution generalization. Rel-SAR leverages the synergy between HD attribute representations and symbolic reasoning to achieve systematic abductive reasoning with both interpretable and computable semantics.",

Recently, neural symbolic reasoning methods have been proposed to map entities and relations into a continuous real vector space and model logical operators as differential neural networks. However, traditional methodss employ negative sampling, which corrupts complex queries to train embeddings. Consequently, these embeddings are susceptible to divergence in the open manifold of Rn\\textbackslash documentclass [ 12pt]\\ minimal\\ \\textbackslash usepackage\\ amsmath\\ \\textbackslash usepackage\\ wasysym\\ \\textbackslash usepackage\\ amsfonts\\ \\textbackslash usepackage\\ amssymb\\ \\textbackslash usepackage\\ amsbsy\\ \\textbackslash usepackage\\ mathrsfs\\ \\textbackslash usepackage\\ upgreek\\ \\textbackslash setlength\\ \\textbackslash oddsidemargin\\ \\ -69pt\\ \\textbackslash begin\\ document\\ \\$\\$\\textbackslash mathbb \\ R\\ <\\^ >n\\$\\$\\textbackslash end\\ document\\ . The appropriate regularization is crucial for addressing the divergence of embeddings. In this paper, we introduces a Lie group as a compact embedding space for complex query embedding, enhancing ability to handle the intricacies of knowledge graphs the foundation model. Our method aims to solve the query of disjunctive and conjunctive problems. Entities and queries are represented as a region of a high-dimensional torus, where the projection, intersection, union, and negation of the torus naturally simulate entities and queries. After simulating the operations on the region of the torus we defined, we found that the resulting geometry remains unchanged. Experiments show that our method achieved a significant improvement on FB15K, FB15K-237, and NELL995. Through extensive experiments on datasets FB15K, FB15K-237, and NELL995, our approach demonstrates significant improvements, leveraging the strengths of knowledge graphs foundation model and complex query processing.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of topical clobetasol propionate 0.05% pomade in the treatment of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. Patients and Methods: Twenty-one idiopathic granulomatous mastitis patients’ clinical and histopathological findings were retrospectively reviewed. Those patients excluded from other etiologies were categorized as idiopathic granulomatous mastitis and treated with topical clobetasol propionate 0.05% pomade as an initial treatment. Results: All 21 patients with a final diagnosis of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis were women with the average age of 36.2+/-5.2 years. Of the 21 patients; erythema, induration and pain problems of 6 (28.5%) patients totally resolved without recurrence in 3 months follow-up period. Erythema, induration and pain problems of 7 (33.5%) patients were minimalized and stay stable in 3 months follow-up period. The symptoms of 8 (38%) did not change under topical clobetasol propionate treatment. None of the patients developed side or adverse effects due to topical steroid treatment and 6 of 18 patients with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) complained of gastric pain. Conclusion:Topical steroid treatment is a safe treatment option for idiopathic granulomatous mastitis patients before systemic steroid and immunosuppressive treatments and also surgery.Alternate abstract: Amaç: İdiyopatik granulomatöz mastit tedavisinde topikal klobetazol propiyonat %0,05 pomadın etkinliğini değerlendirmek. Hastalar ve Yöntemler: Klinik ve histopatolojik olarak idiyopatik granülomatöz mastit tanısı konulan 21 hastanın dosyası retrospektif olarak incelendi. Altta yatan başka patoloji saptanmayan hastalar idiyopatik granülomatöz mastit olarak sınıflandırıldı ve ilk tedavi olarak topikal klobetazol propiyonat % 0,05 pomad uygulandı. Bulgular: İdiyopatik granülomatöz mastit tanılı 21 kadın hastanın yaş ortalaması 36,2 ± 5,2 yıldı. Yirmi bir hastanın 6 (% 28,5)’sının eritem, sertlik ve ağrı problemleri tamamen geriledi ve 3 aylık takip döneminde tekrarlamadı. Hastaların 7 (% 33,5)’sinde eritem, sertlik ve ağrı şikayetleri tama yakın geriledi ve 3 ay süreli takiplerinde artış izlenmedi. Sekiz (%38) hastada iyileşme gözlenmedi. Hastalarda yerel steroid tedavisine bağlı yan etki görülmezken, ek olarak non-steroid antiinflamatuvar (NSAI) ilaç kullanan 18 hastanın 6’sında mide ağrısı şikayetleri gelişti. Sonuç: Yerel steroid tedavileri idiyopatik granülomatöz mastit tedavisinde etkili ve güvenli tedavi seçenekleridir.",

    "abstract": "An important challenge in interactive machine learning, particularly in subjective or ambiguous domains, is fostering bi-directional alignment between humans and models. Users teach models their concept definition through data labeling, while refining their own understandings throughout the process. To facilitate this, we introduce Mocha, an interactive machine learning tool informed by two theories of human concept learning and cognition. First, it utilizes a neuro-symbolic pipeline to support Variation Theory-based counterfactual data generation. By asking users to annotate counterexamples that are syntactically and semantically similar to already-annotated data but predicted to have different labels, the system can learn more effectively while helping users understand the model and reflect on their own label definitions. Second, Mocha uses Structural Alignment Theory to present groups of counterexamples, helping users comprehend alignable differences between data items and annotate them in batch. We validated Mocha’s effectiveness and usability through a lab study with 18 participants.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly influenced everyday computational tasks and the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, their creativity is limited by the conventional data they learn from, particularly lacking in novelty. To enhance creativity in LLMs, this paper introduces an innovative approach using the Learning Intelligent DecisionAgent (LIDA) cognitive architecture. We describe and implement a multimodal vector embeddings-based LIDA in this paper. A LIDA agent from this implementation is used to demonstrate our proposition to make generative AI more creative, specifically making it more novel. By leveraging episodic memory and attention, the LIDA-based agent can relate memories of recent unrelated events to solve current problems with novelty. Our approach incorporates a neuro-symbolic implementation of a LIDA agent that assists in generating creative ideas while illuminating a prompting technique for LLMs to make them more creative. Comparing responses from a baseline LLM and our LIDA-enhanced agent indicates an improvement in the novelty of the ideas generated.",

Our benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We leverage LAMBDA to benchmark current end-to-end learning methods and a modular neuro-symbolic approaches that combines foundation models with task and motion planning. We find that end-to-end methods-even when pretrained-yield lower success rates, while neuro-symbolic methods perform significantly better and require less data.",

Instead, it evaluates logical implications and constraints in a differentiable manner by embedding both neural network outputs and logic programs into matrices. This method facilitates more efficient learning under distant supervision. We evaluated our approach against existing methods while maintaining a constant volume of training data. The findings indicate that our method not only matches or exceeds the accuracy of other methods across various tasks but also speeds up the learning process.

    "abstract": "We introduce an open-ended test grounded in algorithmic probability that can avoid benchmark contamination in the quantitative evaluation of frontier models in the context of their Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligence (ASI) claims. Unlike other tests, this test does not rely on statistical compression methods (such as GZIP or LZW), which are more closely related to Shannon entropy than to Kolmogorov complexity and are not able to test beyond simple pattern matching. The test challenges aspects of AI, in particular LLMs, related to features of intelligence of fundamental nature such as synthesis and model creation in the context of inverse problems (generating new knowledge from observation). We argue that metrics based on model abstraction and abduction (optimal Bayesian `inference') for predictive `planning' can provide a robust framework for testing intelligence, including natural intelligence (human and animal), narrow AI, AGI, and ASI. We found that LLM model versions tend to be fragile and incremental as a result of memorisation only with progress likely driven by the size of training data. The results were compared with a hybrid neurosymbolic approach that theoretically guarantees universal intelligence based on the principles of algorithmic probability and Kolmogorov complexity. The method outperforms LLMs in a proof-of-concept on short binary sequences. We prove that compression is equivalent and directly proportional to a system's predictive power and vice versa. That is, if a system can better predict it can better compress, and if it can better compress, then it can better predict. Our findings strengthen the suspicion regarding the fundamental limitations of LLMs, exposing them as systems optimised for the perception of mastery over human language.",

Starting from a single input image, we reconstruct its facade layout using grammar rules, then edit that structure through user-defined transformations. As facades are inherently multi-hierarchical structures, we introduce hierarchical matching procedure that aligns facade structures at different levels which is used to introduce control maps to guide a generative diffusion pipeline. This approach retains local appearance fidelity while accommodating large-scale edits such as floor duplication or window rearrangement. We provide a thorough evaluation, comparing Pro-DG against inpainting-based baselines and synthetic ground truths. Our user study and quantitative measurements indicate improved preservation of architectural identity and higher edit accuracy. Our novel method is the first to integrate neuro-symbolically derived shape-grammars for modeling with modern generative model and highlights the broader potential of such approaches for precise and controllable image manipulation.",

A potential solution to this issue is Neuro-Symbolic Integration (NeSy), where neural approaches are combined with symbolic reasoning. Most of these methods exploit a neural network to map perceptions to symbols and a logical reasoner to predict the output of the downstream task. These methods exhibit superior generalization capacity compared to fully neural architectures. However, they suffer from several issues, including slow convergence, learning difficulties with complex perception tasks, and convergence to local minima. This paper proposes a simple yet effective method to ameliorate these problems. The key idea involves pretraining a neural model on the downstream task. Then, a NeSy model is trained on the same task via transfer learning, where the weights of the perceptual part are injected from the pretrained network. The key observation of our work is that the neural network fails to generalize only at the level of the symbolic part while being perfectly capable of learning the mapping from perceptions to symbols. We have tested our training strategy on various SOTA NeSy methods and datasets, demonstrating consistent improvements in the aforementioned problems.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "High-quality and high-coverage rule sets are imperative to the success of Neuro-Symbolic Knowledge Graph Completion (NS-KGC) models, because they form the basis of all symbolic inferences. Recent literature builds neural models for generating rule sets, however, preliminary experiments show that they struggle with maintaining high coverage. In this work, we suggest three simple augmentations to existing rule sets: (1) transforming rules to their abductive forms, (2) generating equivalent rules that use inverse forms of constituent relations and (3) random walks that propose new rules. Finally, we prune potentially low quality rules. Experiments over four datasets and five ruleset-baseline settings suggest that these simple augmentations consistently improve results, and obtain up to 7.1 pt MRR and 8.5 pt Hits@1 gains over using rules without augmentations.",

    "abstract": "Understanding narratives requires reasoning about implicit world knowledge related to the causes, effects, and states of situations described in text. At the core of this challenge is how to access contextually relevant knowledge on demand and reason over it. In this paper, we present initial studies toward zero-shot commonsense question answering by formulating the task as inference over dynamically generated commonsense knowledge graphs. In contrast to previous studies for knowledge integration that rely on retrieval of existing knowledge from static knowledge graphs, our study requires commonsense knowledge integration where contextually relevant knowledge is often not present in existing knowledge bases. Therefore, we present a novel approach that generates contextually-relevant symbolic knowledge structures on demand using generative neural commonsense knowledge models. Empirical results on two datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our neuro-symbolic approach for dynamically constructing knowledge graphs for reasoning. Our approach achieves significant performance boosts over pretrained language models and vanilla knowledge models, all while providing interpretable reasoning paths for its predictions.",

    "abstract": "Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However, such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise strictly. We introduce \\(\\textbf{F}\\)aithful \\(\\textbf{L}\\)ogic-\\(\\textbf{A}\\)ided \\(\\textbf{R}\\)easoning and \\(\\textbf{E}\\)xploration (\\(\\textbf{FLARE}\\)), a novel interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t. the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on \\(\\mathbf{7}\\) out of \\(\\mathbf{9}\\) diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further demonstrate that \\(\\textbf{FLARE}\\) allows pinpointing the decisive factors sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during the multi-hop search.",

In this paper, we propose DUSTIN, a novel knowledge infusion approach for sensor-based HAR. DUSTIN concatenates the features automatically extracted by a CNN model from raw sensor data and high-level context data with the ones inferred by a knowledge-based reasoner. In particular, the symbolic features encode common-sense knowledge about the activities which are consistent with the context of the user, and they are infused within the model before the classification layer. We experimentally evaluated DUSTIN on a HAR dataset of mobile devices sensor data that includes 14 different activities performed by 26 users. Our results show that DUSTIN outperforms state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic approaches, with the advantage of requiring a limited amount of training data and training epochs to reach satisfying recognition rates.",

    "abstract": "In the general machine learning domain, solutions based on the integration of deep learning models with knowledge-based approaches are emerging. Indeed, such hybrid systems have the advantage of improving the recognition rate and the model's inter-pretability. At the same time, they require a significantly reduced amount of labeled data to reliably train the model. However, these techniques have been poorly explored in the sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) domain. The common-sense knowledge about activity execution can potentially improve purely data-driven approaches. While a few knowledge infusion approaches have been proposed for HAR, they rely on rigid logic formalisms that do not take into account uncertainty. In this paper, we propose P-NIMBUS, a novel knowledge infusion approach for sensor-based HAR that relies on probabilistic reasoning. A probabilistic ontology is in charge of computing symbolic features that are combined with the features automatically extracted by a CNN model from raw sensor data and high-level context data. In particular, the symbolic features encode probabilistic common-sense knowledge about the activities consistent with the user's surrounding context. These features are infused within the model before the classification layer. We experimentally evaluated P-NIMBUS on a HAR dataset of mobile devices sensor data that includes 14 different activities performed by 25 users. Our results show that P-NIMBUS outperforms state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic approaches, with the advantage of requiring a limited amount of training data to reach satisfying recognition rates (i.e., more than 80% of F1-score with only 20% of labeled data).(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

This hybridization can take many shapes. In this paper, we propose a new formalism for supervised multi-label classification with propositional background knowledge. We introduce a new neurosymbolic technique called semantic conditioning at inference, which only constrains the system during inference while leaving the training unaffected. We discuss its theoritical and practical advantages over two other popular neurosymbolic techniques: semantic conditioning and semantic regularization. We develop a new multi-scale methodology to evaluate how the benefits of a neurosymbolic technique evolve with the scale of the network. We then evaluate experimentally and compare the benefits of all three techniques across model scales on several datasets. Our results demonstrate that semantic conditioning at inference can be used to build more accurate neural-based systems with fewer resources while guaranteeing the semantic consistency of outputs.",

    "abstract": "Digital twins have revolutionized manufacturing and maintenance, allowing us to interact with virtual yet realistic representations of the physical world in simulations to identify potential problems or opportunities for improvement. However, traditional digital twins do not have the ability to communicate with humans using natural language, which limits their potential usefulness. Although conventional natural language processing methods have proven to be effective in solving certain tasks, neuro-symbolic AI offers a new approach that leads to more robust and versatile solutions. In this paper, we propose neuro-symbolic reasoning (NSR)-a fundamental method for interacting with 3D digital twins using natural language. The method understands user requests and contexts to manipulate 3D components of digital twins and is able to read maintenance manuals and implement installations and removal procedures autonomously. A practical neuro-symbolic dataset of machine-understandable manuals, 3D models, and user queries is collected to train the neuro-symbolic reasoning interaction mechanism. The evaluation demonstrates that NSR can execute user commands accurately, achieving 96.2% accuracy on test data. The proposed method has industrial importance since it provides the technology to perform maintenance procedures, request information from manuals, and serve as a tool to interact with complex virtual machinery using natural language.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring and analyzing process traces is a critical task for modern companies and organizations. In scenarios where there is a gap between trace events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way. However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is refined by the AAF-based reasoner. This allows us to also leverage prior knowledge to compensate for the scarcity of example data, as confirmed by experimental results; clearly, this property is particularly useful in settings where data annotation and model optimization costs are subject to stringent constraints.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image models have recently achieved remarkable success with seemingly accurate samples in photo-realistic quality. However as state-of-the-art language models still struggle evaluating precise statements consistently, so do language model based image generation processes. In this work we showcase problems of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like DALL-E with generating accurate samples from statements related to the draw bench benchmark. Furthermore we show that CLIP is not able to rerank those generated samples consistently. To this end we propose LogicRank, a neuro-symbolic reasoning framework that can result in a more accurate ranking-system for such precision-demanding settings. LogicRank integrates smoothly into the generation process of text-to-image models and moreover can be used to further fine-tune towards a more logical precise model.",

    "abstract": "Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are a common and potentially serious consequence of osteoporosis. Yet, they often remain undiagnosed. Opportunistic screening, which involves automated analysis of medical imaging data acquired primarily for other purposes, is a cost-effective method to identify undiagnosed VCFs. In high-stakes scenarios like opportunistic medical diagnosis, model interpretability is a key factor for the adoption of AI recommendations. Rule-based methods are inherently explainable and closely align with clinical guidelines, but they are not immediately applicable to high-dimensional data such as CT scans. To address this gap, we introduce a neurosymbolic approach for VCF detection in CT volumes. The proposed model combines deep learning (DL) for vertebral segmentation with a shape-based algorithm (SBA) that analyzes vertebral height distributions in salient anatomical regions. This allows for the definition of a rule set over the height distributions to detect VCFs. Evaluation of VerSe19 dataset shows that our method achieves an accuracy of 96% and a sensitivity of 91% in VCF detection. In comparison, a black box model, DenseNet, achieved an accuracy of 95% and sensitivity of 91% in the same dataset. Our results demonstrate that our intrinsically explainable approach can match or surpass the performance of black box deep neural networks while providing additional insights into why a prediction was made. This transparency can enhance clinician's trust thus, supporting more informed decision-making in VCF diagnosis and treatment planning.",

    "abstract": "Extracting temporal relations among events from unstructured text has extensive applications, such as temporal reasoning and question answering. While it is difficult, recent development of Neural-symbolic methods has shown promising results on solving similar tasks. Current temporal relation extraction methods usually suffer from limited expressivity and inconsistent relation inference. For example, in TimeML annotations, the concept of intersection is absent. Additionally, current methods do not guarantee the consistency among the predicted annotations. In this work, we propose SMARTER, a neural semantic parser, to extract temporal information in text effectively. SMARTER parses natural language to an executable logical form representation, based on a custom typed lambda calculus. In the training phase, dynamic programming on denotations (DPD) technique is used to provide weak supervision on logical forms. In the inference phase, SMARTER generates a temporal relation graph by executing the logical form. As a result, our neural semantic parser produces logical forms capturing the temporal information of text precisely. The accurate logical form representations of an event given the context ensure the correctness of the extracted relations.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of large observational data sets generated by a reactive system is a common challenge in debugging system failures and determining their root cause. One of the major problems is that these observational data suffer from survivorship bias. Examples include analyzing traffic logs from networks, and simulation logs from circuit design. In such applications, users want to detect non-spurious correlations from observational data and obtain actionable insights about them. In this paper, we introduce log to Neuro-symbolic (Log2NS), a framework that combines probabilistic analysis from machine learning (ML) techniques on observational data with certainties derived from symbolic reasoning on an underlying formal model. We apply the proposed framework to network traffic debugging by employing the following steps. To detect patterns in network logs, we first generate global embedding vector representations of entities such as IP addresses, ports, and applications. Next, we represent large log flow entries as clusters that make it easier for the user to visualize and detect interesting scenarios that will be further analyzed. To generalize these patterns, Log2NS provides an ability to query from static logs and correlation engines for positive instances, as well as formal reasoning for negative and unseen instances. By combining the strengths of deep learning and symbolic methods, Log2NS provides a very powerful reasoning and debugging tool for log-based data. Empirical evaluations on a real internal data set demonstrate the capabilities of Log2NS.",

    "year": "2022",
    "author": "Thomas, Christo Kurisummoottil and Walid, Saad",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SC) aims to communicate reliably with minimal data transfer while simultaneously providing seamless connectivity to heterogeneous services and users. In this paper, a novel emergent SC (ESC) system framework is proposed and is composed of a signaling game for emergent language design and a neuro-symbolic (NeSy) artificial intelligence (AI) approach for causal reasoning. In order to design the language, the signaling game is solved using an alternating maximization between the communicating node's utilities. The emergent language helps create a context-aware transmit vocabulary (minimal semantic representation) and aids the reasoning process (enabling generalization to unseen scenarios) by splitting complex messages into simpler reasoning tasks for the receiver. The causal description at the transmitter is then modeled (a neural component) as a posterior distribution of the relevant attributes present in the data. Using the reconstructed causal state, the receiver evaluates a set of logical formulas (symbolic part) to execute its task. The nodes NeSy reasoning components are implemented by the recently proposed AI tool called Generative Flow Networks, and they are optimized for higher semantic reliability. The ESC system is designed to enhance the novel metrics of semantic information, reliability, distortion and similarity that are designed using rigorous algebraic properties from category theory thereby generalizing the metrics beyond Shannon's notion of uncertainty. Simulation results validate the ability of ESC to communicate efficiently (with reduced bits) and achieve better semantic reliability than conventional wireless and state-of-the-art systems that do not exploit causal reasoning capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Since the advent of Large Language Models a few years ago, they have often been considered the de facto solution for many AI problems. However, in addition to the many deficiencies of LLMs that prevent them from broad industry adoption, such as reliability, cost, and speed, there is a whole class of common real world problems that Large Language Models perform poorly on, namely, constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. These problems are ubiquitous and current solutions are highly specialized and expensive to implement. At Elemental Cognition, we developed our EC AI platform which takes a neuro-symbolic approach to solving constraint satisfaction and optimization problems. The platform employs, at its core, a precise and high performance logical reasoning engine, and leverages LLMs for knowledge acquisition and user interaction. This platform supports developers in specifying application logic in natural and concise language while generating application user interfaces to interact with users effectively. We evaluated LLMs against systems built on the EC AI platform in three domains and found the EC AI systems to significantly outperform LLMs on constructing valid and optimal solutions, on validating proposed solutions, and on repairing invalid solutions.",

    "abstract": "Dialog Structure Induction (DSI) is the task of inferring the latent dialog structure (i.e., a set of dialog states and their temporal transitions) of a given goal-oriented dialog. It is a critical component for modern dialog system design and discourse analysis. Existing DSI approaches are often purely data-driven, deploy models that infer latent states without access to domain knowledge, underperform when the training corpus is limited/noisy, or have difficulty when test dialogs exhibit distributional shifts from the training domain. This work explores a neural-symbolic approach as a potential solution to these problems. We introduce Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic Dialogue Structure Induction (NEUPSL DSI), a principled approach that injects symbolic knowledge into the latent space of a generative neural model. We conduct a thorough empirical investigation on the effect of NEUPSL DSI learning on hidden representation quality, few-shot learning, and out-of-domain generalization performance. Over three dialog structure induction datasets and across unsupervised and semi-supervised settings for standard and cross-domain generalization, the injection of symbolic knowledge using NEUPSL DSI provides a consistent boost in performance over the canonical baselines.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems learn generalised, interpretable rules in a data-efficient manner utilising existing background knowledge. However, current ILP systems require training examples to be specified in a structured logical format. Neural networks learn from unstructured data, although their learned models may be difficult to interpret and are vulnerable to data perturbations at run-time. This paper introduces a hybrid neural-symbolic learning framework, called NSL, that learns interpretable rules from labelled unstructured data. NSL combines pre-trained neural networks for feature extraction with FastLAS, a state-of-the-art ILP system for rule learning under the answer set semantics. Features extracted by the neural components define the structured context of labelled examples and the confidence of the neural predictions determines the level of noise of the examples. Using the scoring function of FastLAS, NSL searches for short, interpretable rules that generalise over such noisy examples. We evaluate our framework on propositional and first-order classification tasks using the MNIST dataset as raw data. Specifically, we demonstrate that NSL is able to learn robust rules from perturbed MNIST data and achieve comparable or superior accuracy when compared to neural network and random forest baselines whilst being more general and interpretable.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 raised the need for automatic medical diagnosis, to increase the physicians' efficiency in managing the pandemic. Among all the techniques for evaluating the status of the lungs of a patient with COVID-19, lung ultrasound (LUS) offers several advantages: portability, cost-effectiveness, safety. Several works approached the automatic detection of LUS imaging patterns related COVID-19 by using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, the decision processes based on DNNs are not fully explainable, which generally results in a lack of trust from physicians. This, in turn, slows down the adoption of such systems. In this work, we use two previously built DNNs as feature extractors at the frame level, and automatically synthesize, by means of an evolutionary algorithm, a decision tree (DT) that aggregates in an interpretable way the predictions made by the DNNs, returning the severity of the patients' conditions according to a LUS score of prognostic value. Our results show that our approach performs comparably or better than previously reported aggregation techniques based on an empiric combination of frame-level predictions made by DNNs. Furthermore, when we analyze the evolved DTs, we discover properties about the DNNs used as feature extractors. We make our data publicly available for further development and reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-thought prompting has demonstrated remarkable performance on various natural language reasoning tasks. However, it tends to perform poorly on tasks which requires solving problems harder than the exemplars shown in the prompts. To overcome this challenge of easy-to-hard generalization, we propose a novel prompting strategy, least-to-most prompting. The key idea in this strategy is to break down a complex problem into a series of simpler subproblems and then solve them in sequence. Solving each subproblem is facilitated by the answers to previously solved subproblems. Our experimental results on tasks related to symbolic manipulation, compositional generalization, and math reasoning reveal that least-to-most prompting is capable of generalizing to more difficult problems than those seen in the prompts. A notable finding is that when the GPT-3 code-davinci-002 model is used with least-to-most prompting, it can solve the compositional generalization benchmark SCAN in any split (including length split) with an accuracy of at least 99% using just 14 exemplars, compared to only 16% accuracy with chain-of-thought prompting. This is particularly noteworthy because neural-symbolic models in the literature that specialize in solving SCAN are trained on the entire training set containing over 15,000 examples. We have included prompts for all the tasks in the Appendix.",

    "abstract": "The success of Large Language Models (LLMs), e.g., ChatGPT, is witnessed by their planetary popularity, their capability of human-like communication, and also by their steadily improved reasoning performance. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs reason. It is an open problem how traditional neural networks can be qualitatively extended to go beyond the statistic paradigm and achieve high-level cognition. Here, we present a novel qualitative extension by generalising computational building blocks from vectors to spheres. We propose Sphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model construction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a microcosm of human rationality. SphNN is a hierarchical neuro-symbolic Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric GNN, and uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of neighbourhood spatial relations to transform the current sphere configuration towards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the validity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch without training data, with the worst computational complexity of O(N). SphNN can evolve into various types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical reasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic unification, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All these suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades. SphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop the two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and human-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This work suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components that prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of rational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.",

    "author": "Dong, Tiansi and Rafet, Sifa",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the hardest tasks in natural language understanding and knowledge engineering. The glass ceiling of 80% F1 score is recently achieved through supervised deep-learning, enriched by a variety of knowledge graphs. Here, we propose a novel neurosymbolic methodology that is able to push the F1 score above 90%. The core of our methodology is a neurosymbolic sense embedding, in terms of a configuration of nested balls in n-dimensional space. The centre point of a ball well-preserves word embedding, which partially fix the locations of balls. Inclusion relations among balls precisely encode symbolic hypernym relations among senses, and enable simple logic deduction among sense embeddings, which cannot be realised before. We trained a Transformer to learn the mapping from a contextualized word embedding to its sense ball embedding, just like playing the game of darts (a game of shooting darts into a dartboard). A series of experiments are conducted by utilizing pre-training n-ball embeddings, which have the coverage of around 70% training data and 75% testing data in the benchmark WSD corpus. The F1 scores in experiments range from 90.1% to 100.0% in all six groups of test data-sets (each group has 4 testing data with different sizes of n-ball embeddings). Our novel neurosymbolic methodology has the potential to break the ceiling of deep-learning approaches for WSD. Limitations and extensions of our current works are listed.",

In this paper, we apply neural pointer networks for conducting reasoning over symbolic knowledge bases. In doing so, we explore the benefits and limitations of encoder-decoder architectures in general and pointer networks in particular for developing accurate, generalizable and robust neuro-symbolic reasoners. Based on our experimental results, pointer networks performs remarkably well across multiple reasoning tasks while outperforming the previously reported state of the art by a significant margin. We observe that the Pointer Networks preserve their performance even when challenged with knowledge graphs of the domain/vocabulary it has never encountered before. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on neuro-symbolic reasoning using Pointer Networks. We hope our impressive results on these reasoning problems will encourage broader exploration of pointer networks' capabilities for reasoning over more complex logics and for other neuro-symbolic problems.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant progress in the development of neural-symbolic frameworks, the question of how to integrate a neural and a symbolic system in a \\emph compositional manner remains open. Our work seeks to fill this gap by treating these two systems as black boxes to be integrated as modules into a single architecture, without making assumptions on their internal structure and semantics. Instead, we expect only that each module exposes certain methods for accessing the functions that the module implements: the symbolic module exposes a deduction method for computing the function's output on a given input, and an abduction method for computing the function's inputs for a given output; the neural module exposes a deduction method for computing the function's output on a given input, and an induction method for updating the function given input-output training instances. We are, then, able to show that a symbolic module - with any choice for syntax and semantics, as long as the deduction and abduction methods are exposed - can be cleanly integrated with a neural module, and facilitate the latter's efficient training, achieving empirical performance that exceeds that of previous work.",

By combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning we develop a model that outperforms purely numerical methods in accuracy and interpretability. Focusing on sextic polynomials with height ≤ 6, we analyze a database of 53,972 irreducible examples, uncovering novel distributional trends, such as the 20 sextic polynomials with Galois group C\\_6 spanning just seven invariant-defined equivalence classes. These findings offer the first empirical insights into Galois group probabilities under height constraints and lay the groundwork for exploring solvability by radicals. Demonstrating AI's potential to reveal patterns beyond traditional symbolic techniques, this work paves the way for future research in computational algebra, with implications for probabilistic conjectures and higher degree classifications.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate whether symbolic semantic representations, extracted from deep semantic parsers, can help reasoning over the states of involved entities in a procedural text. We consider a deep semantic parser (TRIPS) and semantic role labeling as two sources of semantic parsing knowledge. First, we propose PROPOLIS, a symbolic parsing-based procedural reasoning framework. Second, we integrate semantic parsing information into state-of-the-art neural models to conduct procedural reasoning. Our experiments indicate that explicitly incorporating such semantic knowledge improves procedural understanding. This paper presents new metrics for evaluating procedural reasoning tasks that clarify the challenges and identify differences among neural, symbolic, and integrated models.",

    "abstract": "Commonsense reasoning aims to incorporate sets of commonsense facts, retrieved from Commonsense Knowledge Graphs (CKG), to draw conclusion about ordinary situations. The dynamic nature of commonsense knowledge postulates models capable of performing multi-hop reasoning over new situations. This feature also results in having large-scale sparse Knowledge Graphs, where such reasoning process is needed to predict relations between new events. However, existing approaches in this area are limited by considering CKGs as a limited set of facts, thus rendering them unfit for reasoning over new unseen situations and events. In this paper, we present a neural-symbolic reasoner, which is capable of reasoning over large-scale dynamic CKGs. The logic rules for reasoning over CKGs are learned during training by our model. In addition to providing interpretable explanation, the learned logic rules help to generalise prediction to newly introduced events. Experimental results on the task of link prediction on CKGs prove the effectiveness of our model by outperforming the state-of-the-art models.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods for time series have already reached excellent performances in both prediction and classification tasks, including anomaly detection. However, the complexity inherent in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) creates a challenge when it comes to explainability methods. To overcome this inherent lack of interpretability, we propose ECATS, a concept-based neuro-symbolic architecture where concepts are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Leveraging kernel-based methods for STL, concept embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner through a cross-attention mechanism. The network makes class predictions through these concept embeddings, allowing for a meaningful explanation to be naturally extracted for each input. Our preliminary experiments with simple CPS-based datasets show that our model is able to achieve great classification performance while ensuring local interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Symbolic regression with polynomial neural networks and polynomial neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are two recent and powerful approaches for equation recovery of many science and engineering problems. However, these methods provide point estimates for the model parameters and are currently unable to accommodate noisy data. We address this challenge by developing and validating the following Bayesian inference methods: the Laplace approximation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods, and variational inference. We have found the Laplace approximation to be the best method for this class of problems. Our work can be easily extended to the broader class of symbolic neural networks to which the polynomial neural network belongs. Polynomial neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a recent approach for symbolic regression of dynamical systems governed by polynomials. However, they are limited in that they provide maximum likelihood point estimates of the model parameters. The domain expert using system identification often desires a specified level of confidence or range of parameter values that best fit the data. In this work, we use Bayesian inference to provide posterior probability distributions of the parameters in polynomial neural ODEs. To date, there are no studies that attempt to identify the best Bayesian inference method for neural ODEs and symbolic neural ODEs. To address this need, we explore and compare three different approaches for estimating the posterior distributions of weights and biases of the polynomial neural network: the Laplace approximation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and variational inference. We have found the Laplace approximation to be the best method for this class of problems. We have also developed lightweight JAX code to estimate posterior probability distributions using the Laplace approximation.",

    "abstract": "As machine learning models increase in scale and complexity, obtaining sufficient training data has become a critical bottleneck due to acquisition costs, privacy constraints, and data scarcity in specialised domains. While synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising alternative, a notable performance gap remains compared to models trained on real data, particularly as task complexity grows. Concurrently, Neuro-Symbolic methods, which combine neural networks' learning strengths with symbolic reasoning's structured representations, have demonstrated significant potential across various cognitive tasks. This paper explores the utility of Neuro-Symbolic conditioning for synthetic image dataset generation, focusing specifically on improving the performance of Scene Graph Generation models. The research investigates whether structured symbolic representations in the form of scene graphs can enhance synthetic data quality through explicit encoding of relational constraints. The results demonstrate that Neuro-Symbolic conditioning yields significant improvements of up to +2.59% in standard Recall metrics and +2.83% in No Graph Constraint Recall metrics when used for dataset augmentation. These findings establish that merging Neuro-Symbolic and generative approaches produces synthetic data with complementary structural information that enhances model performance when combined with real data, providing a novel approach to overcome data scarcity limitations even for complex visual reasoning tasks.",

    "abstract": "Neural-symbolic approaches have recently gained popularity to inject prior knowledge into a learner without requiring it to induce this knowledge from data. These approaches can potentially learn competitive solutions with a significant reduction of the amount of supervised data. A large class of neural-symbolic approaches is based on First-Order Logic to represent prior knowledge, relaxed to a differentiable form using fuzzy logic. This paper shows that the loss function expressing these neural-symbolic learning tasks can be unambiguously determined given the selection of a t-norm generator. When restricted to supervised learning, the presented theoretical apparatus provides a clean justification to the popular cross-entropy loss, which has been shown to provide faster convergence and to reduce the vanishing gradient problem in very deep structures. However, the proposed learning formulation extends the advantages of the cross-entropy loss to the general knowledge that can be represented by a neural-symbolic method. Therefore, the methodology allows the development of a novel class of loss functions, which are shown in the experimental results to lead to faster convergence rates than the approaches previously proposed in the literature.",

But it does not describe how such an approach can be operationalized. We propose a concrete HDC-based architecture that computes several types of analogy classified by CST.

    "abstract": "Deep learning approaches have sparked much interest in the AI community during the last decade, becoming state-of-the-art in domains such as pattern recognition, computer vision, and data analysis. However, these methods are highly demanding in terms of training data, which is often a major issue in the geospatial and remote sensing fields. One possible solution to this problem comes from the Neuro-Symbolic Integration field (NeSy), where multiple methods have been defined to incorporate background knowledge into the neural network's learning pipeline. One such method is KENN (Knowledge Enhanced Neural Networks), which injects logical knowledge into the neural network's structure through additional final layers. Empirically, KENN showed comparable or better results than other NeSy frameworks in various tasks while being more scalable. Therefore, we propose the usage of KENN for point cloud semantic segmentation tasks, where it has immense potential to resolve issues with small sample sizes and unbalanced classes. While other works enforce the knowledge constraints in post-processing, to the best of our knowledge, no previous methods have injected inject such knowledge into the learning pipeline through the use of a NeSy framework. The experiment results over different datasets demonstrate that the introduction of knowledge rules enhances the performance of the original network and achieves state-of-the-art levels of accuracy, even with subideal training data.",

    "abstract": "Contextual knowledge is important for real-world automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. In this paper, a novel tree-constrained pointer generator (TCPGen) component is proposed that incorporates such knowledge as a list of biasing words into both attention-based encoder-decoder and transducer end-to-end ASR models in a neural-symbolic way. TCPGen structures the biasing words into an efficient prefix tree to serve as its symbolic input and creates a neural shortcut between the tree and the final ASR output distribution to facilitate recognising biasing words during decoding. Systems were trained and evaluated on the Librispeech corpus where biasing words were extracted at the scales of an utterance, a chapter, or a book to simulate different application scenarios. Experimental results showed that TCPGen consistently improved word error rates (WERs) compared to the baselines, and in particular, achieved significant WER reductions on the biasing words. TCPGen is highly efficient: it can handle 5,000 biasing words and distractors and only add a small overhead to memory use and computation cost.",

The inputs to PAN are one or more atoms, representing the conditions of a logic rule, and the output is the conclusion of the rule. The symbolic inputs may include functional terms of arbitrary depth and arity, and the output may include terms constructed from the input functors. Symbolic inputs are encoded as an integer using an invertible encoding function, which is used in reverse to extract the output terms. The main advance of this system is a convention to allow construction of Artificial Neural Networks able to learn rules with the same power of expression as first order definite clauses.

For this purpose, an approach based on the synergy accomplished by a Neurosymbolic AI system, powered with Fuzzy Logic techniques, is introduced to achieve understandable fact-checking classification results. The work proposes a fact-checking approach based on Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) techniques. It extracts the involved entities from textual data in the form of triples that, projected in a vector space, form graphs that effectively highlight contextual information. The classification results are interpreted by exploiting fuzzy set modelling, which aims to improve the presentation of the final results. Specifically, we use the Hits@N metric to design fuzzy variables whose linguistic terms reflect news distribution. Then, by exploiting fuzzy rule design, human-like classification performance evaluation is provided. Through experimental evaluation of the benchmark dataset, our approach shows its effectiveness in discriminating between real and fake news, enhanced by straightforward explanations driven by the fuzzy rule design.",

    "abstract": "Complex events (CEs) play a crucial role in CPS-IoT applications, enabling high-level decision-making in domains such as smart monitoring and autonomous systems. However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.",

    "abstract": "The task of estimating the world model describing the dynamics of a real world process assumes immense importance for anticipating and preparing for future outcomes. For applications such as video surveillance, robotics applications, autonomous driving, etc. this objective entails synthesizing plausible visual futures, given a few frames of a video to set the visual context. Towards this end, we propose ProgGen, which undertakes the task of video frame prediction by representing the dynamics of the video using a set of neuro-symbolic, human-interpretable set of states (one per frame) by leveraging the inductive biases of Large (Vision) Language Models (LLM/VLM). In particular, ProgGen utilizes LLM/VLM to synthesize programs: (i) to estimate the states of the video, given the visual context (i.e. the frames); (ii) to predict the states corresponding to future time steps by estimating the transition dynamics; (iii) to render the predicted states as visual RGB-frames. Empirical evaluations reveal that our proposed method outperforms competing techniques at the task of video frame prediction in two challenging environments: (i) PhyWorld (ii) Cart Pole. Additionally, ProgGen permits counter-factual reasoning and interpretable video generation attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability for video generation tasks.",

    "abstract": "In the area of learning-driven artificial intelligence advancement, the integration of machine learning (ML) into self-driving (SD) technology stands as an impressive engineering feat. Yet, in real-world applications outside the confines of controlled laboratory scenarios, the deployment of self-driving technology assumes a life-critical role, necessitating heightened attention from researchers towards both safety and efficiency. To illustrate, when a self-driving model encounters an unfamiliar environment in real-time execution, the focus must not solely revolve around enhancing its anticipated performance; equal consideration must be given to ensuring its execution or real-time adaptation maintains a requisite level of safety. This study introduces an algorithm for online meta-reinforcement learning, employing lookahead symbolic constraints based on \\emph Neurosymbolic Meta-Reinforcement Lookahead Learning (NUMERLA). NUMERLA proposes a lookahead updating mechanism that harmonizes the efficiency of online adaptations with the overarching goal of ensuring long-term safety. Experimental results demonstrate NUMERLA confers the self-driving agent with the capacity for real-time adaptability, leading to safe and self-adaptive driving under non-stationary urban human-vehicle interaction scenarios.",

Additionally, the increased connectivity has made traditional human-driven penetration testing insufficient for assessing risks and developing remediation strategies. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a distributed, adaptive, and efficient automated penetration testing framework that not only identifies vulnerabilities but also provides countermeasures to enhance security posture. This work presents ADAPT, a game-theoretic and neuro-symbolic framework for automated distributed adaptive penetration testing, specifically designed to address the unique cybersecurity challenges of AI-enabled healthcare infrastructure networks. We use a healthcare system case study to illustrate the methodologies within ADAPT. The proposed solution enables a learning-based risk assessment.

    "abstract": "Forest inventory forms the foundation of forest management. Remote sensing (RS) is an efficient means of measuring forest parameters at scale. Remotely sensed species classification can be used to estimate species abundances, distributions, and to better approximate metrics such as aboveground biomass. State-of-the-art methods of RS species classification rely on deep-learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models have two major drawbacks: they require large samples of each species to classify well and they lack explainability. Therefore, rare species are poorly classified causing poor approximations of their associated parameters. We show that the classification of rare species can be improved by as much as eight F1-points using a neuro-symbolic (NS) approach that combines CNNs with an NS framework. The framework allows for the incorporation of domain knowledge into the model through the use of mathematically represented rules, improving model explainability.",

Accurate ITC delineation benefits biomass estimation, allometry estimation, and species classification among other forest-related tasks, all of which are used to monitor forest health and make important decisions in forest management. In this article, we introduce neuro-symbolic DeepForest, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based ITC delineation algorithm that uses a neuro-symbolic framework to inject domain knowledge (represented as rules written in probabilistic soft logic) into a CNN. We create rules that encode concepts for competition, allometry, constrained growth, mean ITC area, and crown color. Our results show that the delineation model learns from the annotated training data as well as the rules and that under some conditions, the injection of rules improves model performance and affects model bias. We then analyze the effects of each rule on its related aspects of model performance. We find that the addition of domain data can improve F1 by as much as four F1 points, reduce the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) between ground-truth and predicted area distributions, and reduce the aggregate error in area between ground-truth and predicted delineations.",

Control synthesis that uses the robustness semantics of DT-STL poses challenges due to its non-convexity, non-differentiability, and recursive definition, in particular when it is used to train NN-based controllers. We introduce a smooth neuro-symbolic computation graph to encode DT-STL robustness to represent a smooth approximation of the robustness, enabling the use of powerful stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation-based optimization for training. Our approximation guarantees that it lower bounds the robustness value of a given DT-STL formula, and shows orders of magnitude improvement over existing smooth approximations when applied to control synthesis. We demonstrate our approach on planning to satisfy complex spatiotemporal and sequential tasks, and show scalability with formula complexity. Copyright (c) 2024 The Authors.",

    "abstract": "Despite the successes of recent developments in visual AI, different shortcomings still exist; from missing exact logical reasoning, to abstract generalization abilities, to understanding complex and noisy scenes. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks, were not designed to capture more than a few of these aspects. Whereas deep learning datasets focus on visually complex data but simple visual reasoning tasks, inductive logic datasets involve complex logical learning tasks, however, lack the visual component. To address this, we propose the diagnostic visual logical learning dataset, V-LoL, that seamlessly combines visual and logical challenges. Notably, we introduce the first instantiation of V-LoL, V-LoL-Train, - a visual rendition of a classic benchmark in symbolic AI, the Michalski train problem. By incorporating intricate visual scenes and flexible logical reasoning tasks within a versatile framework, V-LoL-Train provides a platform for investigating a wide range of visual logical learning challenges. We evaluate a variety of AI systems including traditional symbolic AI, neural AI, as well as neuro-symbolic AI. Our evaluations demonstrate that even SOTA AI faces difficulties in dealing with visual logical learning challenges, highlighting unique advantages and limitations of each methodology. Overall, V-LoL opens up new avenues for understanding and enhancing current abilities in visual logical learning for AI systems.",

    "abstract": "We propose a learning architecture that allows symbolic control and guidance in reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. We introduce SymDQN, a novel modular approach that augments the existing Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DuelDQN) architecture with modules based on the neuro-symbolic framework of Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs). The modules guide action policy learning and allow reinforcement learning agents to display behaviour consistent with reasoning about the environment. Our experiment is an ablation study performed on the modules. It is conducted in a reinforcement learning environment of a 5x5 grid navigated by an agent that encounters various shapes, each associated with a given reward. The underlying DuelDQN attempts to learn the optimal behaviour of the agent in this environment, while the modules facilitate shape recognition and reward prediction. We show that our architecture significantly improves learning, both in terms of performance and the precision of the agent. The modularity of SymDQN allows reflecting on the intricacies and complexities of combining neural and symbolic approaches in reinforcement learning.",

    "author": "Jaimini, Utkarshani and Henson, Cory and Sheth, Amit",
    "url": "",
    "abstract": "The current method for predicting causal links in knowledge graphs uses weighted causal relations. For a given link between cause-effect entities, the presence of a confounder affects the causal link prediction, which can lead to spurious and inaccurate results. We aim to block these confounders using backdoor path adjustment. Backdoor paths are non-causal association flows that connect the 𝑐𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑒-𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦 to the 𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡-𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑦 through other variables. Removing these paths ensures a more accurate prediction of causal links. This paper proposes CausalLPBack, a novel approach to causal link prediction that eliminates backdoor paths and uses knowledge graph link prediction methods. It extends the representation of causality in a neuro-symbolic framework, enabling the adoption and use of traditional causal AI concepts and methods. We demonstrate our approach using a causal reasoning benchmark dataset of simulated videos. The evaluation involves a unique dataset splitting method called the Markov-based split that's relevant for causal link prediction. The evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates atleast 30% in MRR and 16% in Hits@K inflated performance for causal link prediction that is due to the bias introduced by backdoor paths for both baseline and weighted causal relations.",

    "abstract": "Procedural texts describe dynamic state changes that occur during a step-by-step process (e.g. an instruction manual, photosynthesis, or a baking recipe). As a subtask of procedural text understanding, entity state tracking aims to automatically analyze such documents, identifying relevant information that allows entities’ states and locations to be tracked during a process. This NLP task suffers from the scarcity of annotated data, mainly because obtaining such annotations is difficult and time-consuming. For instance, annotators often rely on commonsense knowledge to annotate implicit information. Recent approaches have successfully incorporated external world knowledge. In particular, Zhang et al. (2021) [111] present a neuro-symbolic model, where commonsense knowledge about entities from ConceptNet is leveraged to guide the model. The model uses a BERT encoder fine-tuned on raw procedural texts to predict entity state changes. We re-implement this model as our baseline, and add linguistic knowledge to allow the model to have access to the lexical semantic information encoded in verbs, using VerbNet. We modify the multi-stage training method presented by [111], and compare the sources of knowledge in the LM fine-tuning step in different experimental settings. The evaluation results on the ProPara dataset [21] show improvements over the baseline, verifying the effectiveness of introducing event semantics over and above commonsense knowledge about entities. In addition, we develop a purely symbolic model for entity state tracking that uses a simple set of case statements, and is informed mostly by linguistic knowledge retrieved from various computational lexical resources. We show that our purely symbolic model is generalizable and explainable and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Recipes dataset [10].",

    "abstract": "Evaluating corporate sustainability performance is essential to drive sustainable business practices, amid the need for a more sustainable economy. However, this is hindered by the complexity and volume of corporate sustainability data (i.e. sustainability disclosures), not least by the effectiveness of the NLP tools used to analyse them. To this end, we identify three primary challenges - immateriality, complexity, and subjectivity, that exacerbate the difficulty of extracting insights from sustainability disclosures. To address these issues, we introduce ESGSenticNet, a publicly available knowledge base for sustainability analysis. ESGSenticNet is constructed from a neurosymbolic framework that integrates specialised concept parsing, GPT-4o inference, and semi-supervised label propagation, together with a hierarchical taxonomy. This approach culminates in a structured knowledge base of 44k knowledge triplets - ('halve carbon emission', supports, 'emissions control'), for effective sustainability analysis. Experiments indicate that ESGSenticNet, when deployed as a lexical method, more effectively captures relevant and actionable sustainability information from sustainability disclosures compared to state of the art baselines. Besides capturing a high number of unique ESG topic terms, ESGSenticNet outperforms baselines on the ESG relatedness and ESG action orientation of these terms by 26% and 31% respectively. These metrics describe the extent to which topic terms are related to ESG, and depict an action toward ESG. Moreover, when deployed as a lexical method, ESGSenticNet does not require any training, possessing a key advantage in its simplicity for non-technical stakeholders.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Dynamic scene understanding is the ability of a computer system to interpret and make sense of the visual information present in a video of a real-world scene. In this thesis, we present a series of frameworks for dynamic scene understanding starting from road event detection from an autonomous driving perspective to complex video activity detection, followed by continual learning approaches for the life-long learning of the models. Firstly, we introduce the ROad event Awareness Dataset (ROAD) for Autonomous Driving, to our knowledge the first of its kind. Due to the lack of datasets equipped with formally specified logical requirements, we also introduce the ROad event Awareness Dataset with logical Requirements (ROAD-R), the first publicly available dataset for autonomous driving with requirements expressed as logical constraints, as a tool for driving neurosymbolic research in the area. Next, we extend event detection to holistic scene understanding by proposing two complex activity detection methods. In the first method, we present a deformable, spatiotemporal scene graph approach, consisting of three main building blocks: action tube detection, a 3D deformable RoI pooling layer designed for learning the flexible, deformable geometry of the constituent action tubes, and a scene graph constructed by considering all parts as nodes and connecting them based on different semantics. In a second approach evolving from the first, we propose a hybrid graph neural network that combines attention applied to a graph encoding of the local (short-term) dynamic scene with a temporal graph modelling the overall long-duration activity. Finally, the last part of the thesis is about presenting a new continual semi-supervised learning (CSSL) paradigm.",

    "abstract": "We present a neural-symbolic framework for observing the environment and continuously learning visual semantics and intuitive physics to reproduce them in an interactive simulation. The framework consists of five parts, a neural-symbolic hybrid network based on capsules for inverse graphics, an episodic memory to store observations, an interaction network for intuitive physics, a meta-learning agent that continuously improves the framework and a querying language that acts as the framework's interface for simulation. By means of lifelong meta-learning, the capsule network is expanded and trained continuously, in order to better adapt to its environment with each iteration. This enables it to learn new semantics using a few-shot approach and with minimal input from an oracle over its lifetime. From what it learned through observation, the part for intuitive physics infers all the required physical properties of the objects in a scene, enabling predictions. Finally, a custom query language ties all parts together, which allows to perform various mental simulation tasks, such as navigation, sorting and simulation of a game environment, with which we illustrate the potential of our novel approach.",

    "abstract": "Many current methods to learn intuitive physics are based on interaction networks and similar approaches. However, they rely on information that has proven difficult to estimate directly from image data in the past. We aim to narrow this gap by inferring all the semantic information needed from raw pixel data in the form of a scene-graph. Our approach is based on neural-symbolic capsules, which identify which objects in the scene are static, dynamic, elastic or rigid, possible joints between them, as well as their collision information. By integrating all this with interaction networks, we demonstrate how our method is able to learn intuitive physics directly from image sequences and apply its knowledge to new scenes and objects, resulting in an inverse-simulation pipeline.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary deep learning architectures lack principled means for capturing and handling fundamental visual concepts, like objects, shapes, geometric transforms, and other higher-level structures. We propose a neurosymbolic architecture that uses a domain-specific language to capture selected priors of image formation, including object shape, appearance, categorization, and geometric transforms. We express template programs in that language and learn their parameterization with features extracted from the scene by a convolutional neural network. When executed, the parameterized program produces geometric primitives which are rendered and assessed for correspondence with the scene content and trained via auto-association with gradient. We confront our approach with a baseline method on a synthetic benchmark and demonstrate its capacity to disentangle selected aspects of the image formation process, learn from small data, correct inference in the presence of noise, and out-of-sample generalization.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we demonstrate how logic programming systems and Automated first-order logic Theorem Provers (ATPs) can improve the accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for logical reasoning tasks where the baseline performance is given by direct LLM solutions. We first evaluate LLM reasoning on steamroller problems using the PRONTOQA benchmark. We show how accuracy can be improved with a neuro-symbolic architecture where the LLM acts solely as a front-end for translating a given problem into a formal logic language and an automated reasoning engine is called for solving it. However, this approach critically hinges on the correctness of the LLM translation. To assess this translation correctness, we secondly define a framework of syntactic and semantic error categories. We implemented the framework and used it to identify errors that LLMs make in the benchmark domain. Based on these findings, we thirdly extended our method with capabilities for automatically correcting syntactic and semantic errors. For semantic error correction we integrate first-order logic ATPs, which is our main and novel contribution. We demonstrate that this approach reduces semantic errors significantly and further increases the accurracy of LLM logical reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Human beings are social creatures. We routinely reason about other agents, and a crucial component of this social reasoning is inferring people's goals as we learn about their actions. In many settings, we can perform intuitive but reliable goal inference from language descriptions of agents, actions, and the background environments. In this paper, we study this process of language driving and influencing social reasoning in a probabilistic goal inference domain. We propose a neuro-symbolic model that carries out goal inference from linguistic inputs of agent scenarios. The neuro part is a large language model (LLM) that translates language descriptions to code representations, and the symbolic part is a Bayesian inverse planning engine. To test our model, we design and run a human experiment on a linguistic goal inference task. Our model closely matches human response patterns and better predicts human judgements than using an LLM alone.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in neuro-symbolic computing. However, the combination of LLM with argumentation computation remains an underexplored domain, despite its considerable potential for real-world applications requiring defeasible reasoning. In this paper, we aim to investigate the capability of LLMs in determining the extensions of various abstract argumentation semantics. To achieve this, we develop and curate a benchmark comprising diverse abstract argumentation frameworks, accompanied by detailed explanations of algorithms for computing extensions. Subsequently, we fine-tune LLMs on the proposed benchmark, focusing on two fundamental extension-solving tasks. As a comparative baseline, LLMs are evaluated using a chain-of-thought approach, where they struggle to accurately compute semantics. In the experiments, we demonstrate that the process explanation plays a crucial role in semantics computation learning. Models trained with explanations show superior generalization accuracy compared to those trained solely with question-answer pairs. Furthermore, by leveraging the self-explanation capabilities of LLMs, our approach provides detailed illustrations that mitigate the lack of transparency typically associated with neural networks. Our findings contribute to the broader understanding of LLMs' potential in argumentation computation, offering promising avenues for further research in this domain.",

This approach has the following objectives: (i) allowing the use of subsymbolic data as an input, (ii) retaining the flexibility and modularity on the definitions of complex event rules, (iii) allowing the system to be trained in an end-to-end manner and (iv) being robust against noisily labelled data. Our approach makes use of DeepProbLog to create a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines a neural network to process the subsymbolic data with a probabilistic logic layer to allow the user to define the rules for the complex events. We demonstrate that our approach is capable of detecting complex events from an audio stream. We also demonstrate that our approach is capable of training even with a dataset that has a moderate proportion of noisy data.",

    "abstract": "For various artificial intelligence systems, automatic text understanding algorithms that go beyond mere pattern recognition are helpful. For instance, understanding web pages is beneficial for Information Retrieval (IR) systems to retrieve relevant information. In the most common form, IR systems retrieve relevant information as entities or documents in response to keywords-based queries. Traditional IR models use lexical matching between the query terms and document terms to identify relevant documents. With the emergence of neural networks, Neural IR approaches utilize deep learning techniques to learn high-dimensional representations of documents and queries that go beyond term matching.On the other hand, with the development of symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs), the IR models leverage the semantic information in the form of entities or concepts (e.g., relations, name, description, type, etc.) to retrieve relevant information. Entities are physical objects or things, such as people, places, organizations, etc., representing world knowledge. Traditionally, lexical matching between the query terms and semantic information of entities (e.g., related entities, name, description, type, etc.) is used to recognize the relevant information.This thesis aims to advance state-of-the-art text understanding by developing novel neuro-symbolic algorithms that combine the strengths of two paradigms: the symbolic knowledge graph and the textual documents. Our goal is to leverage the interplay between textual documents and the semantic information of entities to retrieve relevant information. In the first part of this thesis, we devise algorithms to understand how to best utilize the relations between symbolic entities in textual documents to identify relevant entities. In the second part of the thesis, we explore the intricacies of the connections between the symbolic knowledge and the textual documents to generate neuro-symbolic representations for identifying relevant information in the form of entities and documents. To achieve this, we develop novel neuro-symbolic models that identify relevant connections between symbolic knowledge and textual documents and leverage these connections to retrieve relevant information.",

    "url": "",
    "abstract": "Neuro-symbolic learning (NSL) models complex symbolic rule patterns into latent variable distributions by neural networks, which reduces rule search space and generates unseen rules to improve downstream task performance. Centralized NSL learning involves directly acquiring data from downstream tasks, which is not feasible for federated learning (FL). To address this limitation, we shift the focus from such a one-to-one interactive neuro-symbolic paradigm to one-to-many Federated Neuro-Symbolic Learning framework (FedNSL) with latent variables as the FL communication medium. Built on the basis of our novel reformulation of the NSL theory, FedNSL is capable of identifying and addressing rule distribution heterogeneity through a simple and effective Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint on rule distribution applicable under the FL setting. It further theoretically adjusts variational expectation maximization (V-EM) to reduce the rule search space across domains. This is the first incorporation of distribution-coupled bilevel optimization into FL. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate significant advantages of FedNSL compared to five state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms the best baseline by 17% and 29% in terms of unbalanced average training accuracy and unseen average testing accuracy, respectively.",

We thus propose PE Malware Ontology that offers a reusable semantic schema for Portable Executable (PE - the Windows binary format) malware files.

    "abstract": "Natural language as a medium for human-computer interaction has long been anticipated, has been undergoing a sea-change with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) with startling capacities for processing and generating language. Many of us now treat LLMs as modern-day oracles, asking it almost any kind of question. Unlike its Delphic predecessor, consulting an LLM does not have to be a single-turn activity (ask a question, receive an answer, leave); and - also unlike the Pythia - it is widely acknowledged that answers from LLMs can be improved with additional context. In this paper, we aim to study when we need multi-turn interactions with LLMs to successfully get a question answered; or conclude that a question is unanswerable. We present a neural symbolic framework that models the interactions between human and LLM agents. Through the proposed framework, we define incompleteness and ambiguity in the questions as properties deducible from the messages exchanged in the interaction, and provide results from benchmark problems, in which the answer-correctness is shown to depend on whether or not questions demonstrate the presence of incompleteness or ambiguity (according to the properties we identify). Our results show multi-turn interactions are usually required for datasets which have a high proportion of incompleteness or ambiguous questions; and that that increasing interaction length has the effect of reducing incompleteness or ambiguity. The results also suggest that our measures of incompleteness and ambiguity can be useful tools for characterising interactions with an LLM on question-answeringproblems",

    "abstract": "The autonomous driving (AD) industry is exploring the use of knowledge graphs (KGs) to manage the vast amount of heterogeneous data generated from vehicular sensors. The various types of equipped sensors include video, LIDAR and RADAR. Scene understanding is an important topic in AD which requires consideration of various aspects of a scene, such as detected objects, events, time and location. Recent work on knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) - an approach that facilitates neuro-symbolic fusion - has shown to improve the predictive performance of machine learning models. With the expectation that neuro-symbolic fusion through KGEs will improve scene understanding, this research explores the generation and evaluation of KGEs for autonomous driving data. We also present an investigation of the relationship between the level of informational detail in a KG and the quality of its derivative embeddings. By systematically evaluating KGEs along four dimensions - i.e. quality metrics",

    "abstract": "We present a complete theoretical and empirical framework establishing feedforward neural networks as universal finite-state machines (N-FSMs). Our results prove that finite-depth ReLU and threshold networks can exactly simulate deterministic finite automata (DFAs) by unrolling state transitions into depth-wise neural layers, with formal characterizations of required depth, width, and state compression. We demonstrate that DFA transitions are linearly separable, binary threshold activations allow exponential compression, and Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes can be embedded into continuous latent spaces while preserving separability. We also formalize the expressivity boundary: fixed-depth feedforward networks cannot recognize non-regular languages requiring unbounded memory. Unlike prior heuristic or probing-based studies, we provide constructive proofs and design explicit DFA-unrolled neural architectures that empirically validate every claim. Our results bridge deep learning, automata theory, and neural-symbolic computation, offering a rigorous blueprint for how discrete symbolic processes can be realized in continuous neural systems.",

    "abstract": "Can large language models (LLMs) directly serve as powerful world models for model-based agents? While the gaps between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environment's dynamics do exist, our study reveals that the gaps can be bridged by aligning an LLM with its deployed environment and such world alignment can be efficiently achieved by rule learning on LLMs. Given the rich prior knowledge of LLMs, only a few additional rules suffice to align LLM predictions with the specified environment dynamics. To this end, we propose a neurosymbolic approach to learn these rules gradient-free through LLMs, by inducing, updating, and pruning rules based on comparisons of agent-explored trajectories and world model predictions. The resulting world model is composed of the LLM and the learned rules. Our embodied LLM agent WALL-E is built upon model-predictive control (MPC). By optimizing look-ahead actions based on the precise world model, MPC significantly improves exploration and learning efficiency. Compared to existing LLM agents, WALL-E's reasoning only requires a few principal rules rather than verbose buffered trajectories being included in the LLM input. On open-world challenges in Minecraft and ALFWorld, WALL-E achieves higher success rates than existing methods, with lower costs on replanning time and the number of tokens used for reasoning. In Minecraft, WALL-E exceeds baselines by 15-30% in success rate while costing 8-20 fewer replanning rounds and only 60-80% of tokens. In ALFWorld, its success rate surges to a new record high of 95% only after 6 iterations.",

    "abstract": "Can we build accurate world models out of large language models (LLMs)? How can world models benefit LLM agents? The gap between the prior knowledge of LLMs and the specified environment's dynamics usually bottlenecks LLMs' performance as world models. To bridge the gap, we propose a training-free world alignment that learns an environment's symbolic knowledge complementary to LLMs. The symbolic knowledge covers action rules, knowledge graphs, and scene graphs, which are extracted by LLMs from exploration trajectories and encoded into executable codes to regulate LLM agents' policies. We further propose an RL-free, model-based agent WALL-E 2.0 through the model-predictive control (MPC) framework. Unlike classical MPC requiring costly optimization on the fly, we adopt an LLM agent as an efficient look-ahead optimizer of future steps' actions by interacting with the neurosymbolic world model. While the LLM agent's strong heuristics make it an efficient planner in MPC, the quality of its planned actions is also secured by the accurate predictions of the aligned world model. They together considerably improve learning efficiency in a new environment. On open-world challenges in Mars (Minecraft like) and ALFWorld (embodied indoor environments), WALL-E 2.0 significantly outperforms existing methods, e.g., surpassing baselines in Mars by 16.1%-51.6% of success rate and by at least 61.7% in score. In ALFWorld, it achieves a new record 98% success rate after only 4 iterations.",
